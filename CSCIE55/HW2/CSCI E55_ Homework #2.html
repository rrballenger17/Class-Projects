Static analysis means that FindBugs can find bugs by simply inspecting a program's code: executing the program is not necessary.  This makes FindBugs very easy to use: in general, you should be able to use it to look for bugs in your code within a few minutes of downloading it.  FindBugs works by analyzing Java bytecode (compiled class files), so you don't even need the program's source code to use it.

<h2>Specification of Requirements</h2>

This homework extends <a href="http://courses.dce.harvard.edu/~cscie55/hw1-14.html">Homework 1</a> in
the following ways:

<ul>
  <li>There are two new types of object, <tt>Building</tt>
  and <tt>Floor</tt>. The <tt>Elevator</tt> moves passengers between
  <tt>Floor</tt>s. The <tt>Elevator</tt> and all of
  the <tt>Floor</tt>s are part of a
  <tt>Building</tt>.

  <li>The <tt>Elevator</tt> will limit the number of passengers it can
    carry, throwing an exception if an attempt is made to board
    passengers past this
    limit.

  <li>Instead of writing a <tt>main(String[] args)</tt>, your implementation will be tested
    by a JUnit test that you can download from <a href="HW2ElevatorSimulationTest.java">here</a>.
</ul>

<p>While it is recommended that you extend your Homework 1 code, that is
not required, and you may prefer to start Homework 2 from
  scratch. Either approach is fine. The requirements given below are
  written as an extension of the <a href="hw1-14.html">Homework 1</a> requirements.

<p>The <tt>Elevator</tt> moves exactly as it did last time, stopping
  at <tt>Floor</tt>s to disembark passengers, and to pick up new
  passengers. But now, if a passenger tries to board
  the <tt>Elevator</tt> when it is already loaded to capacity,
  an <tt>ElevatorFullException</tt> will be thrown. That should
  prevent the passenger from boarding. The <tt>Elevator</tt> will pick
  up the passengers that could not be accommodated when it next visits
  the
  <tt>Floor</tt>. Remember that in Homework 1 the <tt>Elevator</tt>
  class had an array of flags (one per floor) indicating if a stop was
  needed on that floor. That flag should remain set if not all
  passengers could board the <tt>Elevator</tt>. But if all passengers
  waiting could board, the flag can be cleared.

<h2>Tasks</h2>

<h3>Code organization</h3>

The <tt>Elevator</tt>, <tt>Floor</tt> and <tt>Building</tt> classes all go into the package
cscie55.hw2. If you define any additional classes, they should also
go into this package (and should <i>not</i> be declared public).

<h3>The <tt>Elevator</tt> class</h3>

Starting with <tt>Elevator</tt> from homework 1, add the following public
  methods and fields*:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>int currentFloor()</tt>: Return the elevator's current
      floor number. I.e., this is the number of the floor reached by
      the last call to <tt>Elevator.move()</tt>.

      <li><tt>int passengers()</tt>: Return the number of passengers
      currently on the elevator.

      <li><tt>void boardPassenger(int destinationFloorNumber) throws ElevatorFullException</tt>:
        Board a passenger who wants to ride to the indicated
        floor. Note that this method boards a single passenger and may throw
        an <tt>ElevatorFullException</tt>.

      <li><tt>Elevator.CAPACITY</tt> is a final static field that 
      stores the number of passengers
       that the elevator can accommodate. Set it to 10.

    </ul>

  <p>*[Note that the term <i>field</i> is used here as synonymous with the terms
"instance variable" and "state variable".]
  <p>Also, replace the <tt>Elevator()</tt> constructor
  by <tt>Elevator(Building building)</tt>. (Hint: You may find it
  useful to record the <tt>building</tt> in a new field of <tt>Elevator</tt>.)


<h3>The <tt>Floor</tt> class</h3>

This is a new class, representing one of the
floors that the <tt>Elevator</tt> can visit. It should have the following
public methods:

  <ul>
    <li><tt>int passengersWaiting()</tt>: Returns the number of
    passengers on the floor who are waiting for the elevator.

    <li><tt>void waitForElevator()</tt>: Called when a passenger on
    the floor wants to wait for the elevator. Calling this should
    cause the elevator to stop the next time it moves to the floor.
    For this homework assume that passengers waiting for the elevator 
    on floors 2 and above should all be boarded as going to the first 
    floor. (We'll drop this assumption in the next homework.)

    <li><tt>Floor(Building building, int floorNumber)</tt>:
    The <tt>Floor</tt> constructor.      
  </ul>

  <p>You will need to decide what fields the <tt>Floor</tt> class
  should have.  Note that to meet the first two requirements
  a Floor object must retain a piece of state
  that records the number of passengers it has waiting for an Elevator.

<h3>The <tt>Building</tt> class</h3>

This is a new class, which keeps track of one <tt>Elevator</tt> and
  multiple <tt>Floor</tt>s. It provides access to these objects for
  tests. <tt>Building</tt> has the following public methods and fields.

    <ul>
      <li><tt>Elevator elevator()</tt>: Returns the building's <tt>Elevator</tt>

      <li><tt>Floor floor(int floorNumber)</tt>: Returns
      the <tt>Floor</tt> object for the given floor number.

      <li><tt>FLOORS</tt>: A static final field storing the number of floors
      in the building. Set the value to 7.

      <li><tt>Building()</tt>: The <tt>Building</tt> constructor
      creates an <tt>Elevator</tt>, and one floor for each floor
      number. (Move the <tt>FLOORS</tt> variable, that was in
      the <tt>Elevator</tt> class in homework 1 to
      the <tt>Building</tt> class.)

    </ul>

<p>These specifications are <i>requirements</i>. As such, they specify
things that must be done in any correct implementation. You are, of
course, free to add other methods (as long as they are not public) and
any fields (that should probably not be public).
          
<h3>The <tt>ElevatorFullException</tt> class</h3>

<p>This needs to be a public class,
  extending <tt>java.lang.Exception</tt>.

<p><tt>ElevatorFullException</tt>, like any other exception, must be
<i>thrown</i> when something out of the ordinary happens. Because we do not
want this exception to end execution of your program, some other code
must <i>catch</i> <tt>ElevatorFullException</tt> and handle the
situation, (i.e., that the elevator cannot board a 
passenger when it is full).

<p>In this case, <tt>Elevator.boardPassenger(int
    destinationFloorNumber)</tt>
    throws <tt>ElevatorFullException</tt> when the elevator is already at capacity.

<p><tt>Elevator.boardPassenger(int
    destinationFloorNumber)</tt> is called when the <tt>Elevator</tt>
    stops on a floor, some passengers leave, and the passengers
    waiting on that floor try to board. This code must catch the
    exception, e.g.

<pre>
    try {
        ...
        elevator.boardPassenger(...); <font color=green>// May throw ElevatorFullException</font>
        <font color=green>// The passenger boarded successfully</font>
        ...
    } catch (ElevatorFullException e) {
        <font color=green>// The passenger was unable to board because the elevator is full.</font>
        ...
    }
</pre>  
<a name="design"/>
<h2>Design Considerations and Gotchas</h2>
It should be clear from the requirements that there must be communication between
<font face="courier new"><b>Floor</b></font> objects and <font face="courier new"><b>Elevator</b></font>  objects.  This is in order that the
 <font face="courier new"><b>Elevator</b></font> knows when there are 
passengers waiting to board when it
arrives at a <font face="courier new"><b>Floor</b></font> and that 
the <font face="courier new"><b>Elevator</b></font>
can tell its current<font face="courier new"><b> Floor</b></font> when it has boarded
one of the waiting passengers.  In other words, your model must maintain data 
integrity.  There are different design approaches to achieve this.  It's up to you
which approach to take, so long as it works and so long as the code
that implements it is easy to understand.
<p>
Array sizing and indexing present potentially fatal <i>gotchas</i>.  If you
create an array to represent data for 7 floors and
you size the array to be 7 cells, its <font face="courier new"><b>0</b></font>th element will map to floor
number <font face="courier new"><b>1</b></font> and its 
<font face="courier new"><b>6</b></font>th element will correspond to floor # 7.  When you want the data
for the <font face="courier new"><b>i</b></font>th floor it will be in cell <font face="courier new"><b>i-1</b></font>.  The key to avoid indexing errors is careful
attention to preserve this mapping.


<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>In Homework 1, you demonstrated that your code was working by writing
a <tt>main(String[] args)</tt> method that created
an <tt>Elevator</tt>, set up some passengers, and then
called <tt>Elevator.move()</tt> and generated output to show that
things were working properly.

<p>A more common approach to testing is to write <i>self-testing</i>
code. You write a test that sets up initial conditions, moves
the <tt>Elevator</tt> a few times, and then examines the state of
the <tt>Elevator</tt> to see that all is as expected. A program like
this has no output if all works well. However, if any state
is <i>not</i> as expected, this results in an assertion failure, which
is printed, and that test is then reported as failing.
<p>The most common self-testing framework for Java
  is <a href="http://junit.org">JUnit</a>.

<p>As before, submit the output you get when you run your program.
  If all goes well, there should be minimal output, e.g.

<pre>
    JUnit version 4.11
    ....
    Time: 0.006

    OK (4 tests)
</pre>

If you don't see something like this, and there is output indicating
tests failing, and containing stack traces,
then tests are failing. Figure out what's going wrong and keep
debugging until you get a clean run.

<h3>Getting started with JUnit</h3>
<p>  For general background on JUnit see
the lecture page <a href="UnitTesting.htm"> Unit Testing with JUnit</a>
<p>The first thing to do is to
  download <a href="HW2ElevatorSimulationTest.java">the test code</a>.
  The class of this Java code is
  <tt>cscie55.hw2test.HW2ElevatorSimulationTest</tt>. Note that the
  package is <i>not</i> <tt>cscie55.hw2</tt>, it
  is <tt>cscie55.hw2test</tt>.

<p>Your code should be structured something like this:

<pre>
    src/
        cscie55/
            hw2/
                Building.java
                Elevator.java
                ElevatorFullException.java
                Floor.java
    test/
        cscie55/
            hw2test/
                HW2ElevatorSimulationTest.java
</pre>  
  
<p>If you are using an IDE (probably Eclipse or Intellij), then it should
already know how to run JUnit tests. E.g., in Intellij, create a new
run configuration, selecting JUnit4 (not JUnit3).

<h3>If you are not using an IDE</h3>
  
<p>If instead, you are using the command line, you will need to
  download two jar files, and include them on your classpath. The two
  jar files are:

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://hamcrest.googlecode.com/files/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar">hamcrest-core-1.3.jar</a>
    <li><a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/junit/junit/4.11/junit-4.11.jar">junit-4.11.jar</a>
  </ul>

<p>Put these jar files somewhere convenient, e.g. in a <tt>lib</tt>
  directory in your home directory. Your classpath must include both these
  jar files as well as directions to the classes in your src and test
  directories. (For jar files, your classpath must include each jar file
  explicitly. If you just include a directory containing the jar files,
  then the jar files themselves will not be found.)  This makes four separate paths
  in your classpath, one each explicitly for the jar files, and separate paths
  to locate the class files in the two packages.
  

<p>Because you are running a junit test, the class you run
  is <tt>org.junit.runner.JUnitCore</tt>.
  There is one argument, the name of the
  test, <tt>cscie55.hw2test.HW2ElevatorSimulationTest</tt>

<p>On my Mac, this command is as follows:

<pre>
    java -classpath "/Users/jao/jars/junit-4.11.jar:/Users/jao/jars/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:/Users/jao/teaching/cscie55/spring2014/hw2/out/test/hw2:/Users/jao/teaching/cscie55/spring2014/hw2/out/production/hw2" org.junit.runner.JUnitCore cscie55.hw2test.HW2ElevatorSimulationTest
</pre>

<p> You will need to adjust this for your environment.
