<h1>Homework # 4 Due Monday March 28th, Grade: 10%</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of this homework is to experiment with synchronizing
access to objects shared by multiple threads. The 
provided test
program will create the threads. You will create Bank and Account
objects, and synchronize operations on them performed by the threads.

<p>You will write code to simulate a Bank, which manages a set of
Accounts. Each Account has a balance. The only transaction processed
by this Bank is the transfer of funds from one Account to
another. Multiple threads will run these transfer operations
simultaneously, so of course it is possible for the same Account to be
accessed simultaneously by different threads. A correct implementation
will find that the total of all Account balances is the same at the
beginning and end of the simulation. Incorrect implementations are
likely to fail either by having the beginning and ending balances
disagree, or with some threads becoming stuck and never completing.

<p>For example, suppose that there are three accounts, each with $100:

<pre>
    Account 1: 100
    Account 2: 100
    Account 3: 100
</pre>

<p>Suppose also that there are two threads, one transferring $25 from
Account 1 to Account 2, and the other transferring $50 from Account 3
to Account 1. Once both of these transactions are done, the accounts
should have the following balances: 

<pre>
    Account 1: 125
    Account 2: 125
    Account 3:  50
</pre>

<p>Note that the sum of balances is $300 before the transactions run, and
after both are complete.

<p>Both transactions update Account 1, and if synchronization is not done
correctly, then it is possible to lose one of the modifications of
Account 1's balance. This would leave the final total different from
$300. (You should see this happen while working on this homework.)

<p>Your submission will
combine <a href="hw4provided-sources.jar">provided code</a>, along
with code that you
write. The <a href="hw4provided-sources.jar">provided code</a>
contains two interfaces that you will implement, some exception
classes, and a JUnit test. The combined code should be organized as
follows:

<pre>
          src/
              cscie55/
                  hw4/
                      bank/
                          AccountImpl                   To be written
                          Account                       Provided
                          BankImpl                      To be written
                          Bank                          Provided
                          DuplicateAccountException     Provided
                          InsufficientFundsException    Provided
          test/
              cscie55/
                  hw4/
                      Tester                            Provided
</pre>

<h2>Implement the Account interface</h2>

<pre>
    package cscie55.hw4.bank;
    
    public interface Account
    {
        int id();
        long balance();
        void deposit(long amount);
        void withdraw(long amount) throws InsufficientFundsException;
    }
</pre>

<p>Copy Account into your project and then define a class implementing
this interface, named AccountImpl. Balances are of type long, (you can
think of the balance as tracking pennies instead of dollars). Your
implementation should throw InsufficientFundsException if withdraw
attempts to withdraw an amount exceeding the Account's balance.

<h2>Implement the Bank interface</h2>

<pre>
    package cscie55.hw4.bank;

    public interface BankInterface
    {
        void addAccount(Account account);
        void transferWithoutLocking(int fromId, int toId, long amount) throws InsufficientFundsException;
        void transferLockingBank(int fromId, int toId, long amount) throws InsufficientFundsException;
        void transferLockingAccounts(int fromId, int toId, long amount) throws InsufficientFundsException;
        long totalBalances();
        int numberOfAccounts();
    }
</pre>

<p>Copy Bank into your project and then define a class implementing this
interface, named BankImpl. Note that there are three methods doing
transfers between accounts:

<ol>
<li><b><tt>transferWithoutLocking</tt></b> just calls withdraw on one account, and
deposit on the other, without doing any synchronization.  In other
words, your implementation of BankImpl.transferWithoutLocking should
not use the synchronized keyword at all.  This is completely wrong,
but will give you some idea of what happens when synchronization is
missing.

<li><b><tt>transferLockingBank</tt></b> does the transfer while synchronizing on the
Bank object. This means that only one thread can do a transfer at any
given moment.  While this approach does not provide any concurrency,
it should be correct.

<li><b><tt>transferLockingAccounts</tt></b> does the transfer, locking
just the two affected Accounts.  Your implementation should use the
synchronized keyword twice, once on each Account.  This should provide
for greater concurrency, because threads not touching the two Accounts
will not be blocked. Think very carefully about how to lock the two
Accounts.
</ol>

<p>The supplied test code (<tt>cscie55.hw4.Tester</tt>) will call these methods to try
different locking strategies.

<p>addAccount adds an Account to the Bank. No two Accounts should have
the same id. If an Account is added with a duplicate id, then
addAccount must throw DuplicateAccountException.

<p>You can assume that the methods addAccount, totalBalances and
numberOfAccounts do not require synchronization.

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>You should not write a main() method. Instead, include
<tt>cscie55.hw4.Tester</tt> which contains JUnit tests. You can run the tests
from your IDE, or from the command line as follows:

<pre>
    java -classpath $CLASSPATH org.junit.runner.JUnitCore cscie55.hw4.Tester
</pre>

<p>where $CLASSPATH references all the class files resulting from
<tt>cscie55.hw4</tt> and <tt>cscie55.hw4.bank</tt>, and the junit and
hamcrest jar files. For example, my CLASSPATH looks like this (split up into separate 
lines for readability):

<pre>
    /home/jao/cscie55/hw4/writeup/out/test/hw4:
    /home/jao/cscie55/hw4/writeup/out/production/hw4:
    /home/jao/cscie55/hw4/writeup/lib/junit-4.11.jar:
    /home/jao/cscie55/hw4/writeup/lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
</pre>

<p>Most of the tests within Tester are single-threaded, and ensure that
Account and Bank handle their inputs correctly. testPerformance is
quite different. It does not test correctness at all, i.e., it does
not contain any JUnit assertions. This test has two purposes. First,
unlike the other tests, it starts a number of threads, each submitting
transfer requests to the Bank. If the Bank's totalBalances don't agree
before and after the transfers, output will indicate this, although
the test will not fail, (because we want to continue and gather output
from the remaining scenarios.) Second, the test does timings,
reporting the amount of time to do 5,000,000 transfers using 1, 2, 5,
10, and 20 threads, for each of the three locking strategies.

<p>You need to submit:

<ul>
<li>A source jar file containing the .java files in
<tt>cscie55.hw4.bank</tt>. (This should contain the classes AccountImpl,
Account, BankImpl, Bank, DuplicateAccountException, and
InsufficientFundsException.)

<li>A classes jar file containing the .class files in <tt>cscie55.hw4.bank</tt>.

<li>Output from running the test.

<li>Answers to the following questions regarding testPerformance output:
<ol>
<li>Why does the NO_LOCKING test succeed for one thread and fail for
2-20 threads? (It is possible that you will see some successes for
larger number of threads. But if you see no failures, then something
is amiss.)

<li>How do you explain the change in performance for LOCK_BANK as
threads increase from 1 to 20.

<li>How does the performance of LOCK_BANK compare to that of
LOCK_ACCOUNTS? How do you explain this?
</ol>
</ul>

<h2>Things to watch out for</h2>

<ul>
<li>If testPerformance never completes, it is possible that the test
threads have become deadlocked. To get a start on this problem,
figure out how to obtain and read a stack dump.

<li>The Bank tranfer methods throw InsufficientFundsException on an
attempt to withdraw more than the balance. If this happens, (and it
will almost certainly happen during testPerformance), then the
balances of both accounts must be left unmodified. You need to write
code carefully to ensure that nothing has changed when
InsufficientFundsException is thrown. Another approach, which is
more complicated (and therefore inferior) discovers the need to
throw InsufficientFundsException after one or both balances have
been updated, in which case you need to ensure that the balances are
restored to their previous values.

<li><b>Strongly recommended:</b> Comment out testPerformance until the other
tests are running successfully. Otherwise, you may waste a lot of
time waiting for testPerformance to run when far more basic tests
are failing.
