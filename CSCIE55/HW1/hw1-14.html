<h2>Specification of Requirements</h2>

<p>In the first three homeworks, you will develop a simulation for a
building's elevator system. The major objects you will deal with are:

<ul>
  <li><b>Building:</b> Contains multiple Floors and one
  Elevator. (While multiple Elevators are possible, the homeworks will
  only deal with one.)

  <li><b>Elevator:</b> Carries Passengers between Floors. Has a
  limited capacity.

  <li><b>Floor:</b> Passengers spend some time on a Floor, and then use the
    Elevator to go to another Floor. 

  <li><b>Passenger:</b> A person who enters and leaves the Building. While inside
    the Building, a Passenger is either on a Floor, or in the Elevator,
    moving between Floors.
</ul>

<p>In the first homework, you will only be concerned with the Elevator
object. The other objects will be added in later homeworks. This
initial version of the Elevator class will keep track of the number of passengers  for each
floor destined for each floor, and whether a
stop on that floor is required. Any number of passengers may board the
elevator. Elevator capacity will be limited in later homeworks.

<p>The elevator starts on the ground floor and goes up. When it reaches
the top floor it starts going down. It keeps moving, stopping only at
destination floors.
A stop on a floor is necessary if there are passengers destined for
that floor. In later homeworks, a passenger on a floor may summon the
elevator, requiring it to stop there, even if the elevator is not
carrying any passengers who want to get off there.

<p>When the elevator stops on a destination floor, it should discharge
the passengers who wanted to go there, and note that the floor is no
longer a destination.

<h2>Tasks</h2>

<h3>Elevator class</h3>

Write an Elevator class as follows:

<ul>
  <li>Create an <font face="courier new"><b>Elevator</b></font> class in the package
  <font face="courier new"><b>cscie55.hw1.elevator</b></font> .The class should have a no-argument
  constructor that sets up the elevator's state.

  <li>Define a constant, (i.e., a static final field), for the number
    of floors in the building, and set it to 7. Use it where appropriate.

  <li>Define fields for tracking the elevator's current floor, the
    direction of travel.

  <li>Define array-valued fields for tracking, for each floor, the
    number of passengers destined for that floor, and whether a stop
    is required for that floor.

  <li>Define a <font face="courier new"><b>move()</b></font> method which, when called, modifies the
    <font face="courier new"><b>Elevator</b></font>'s state, (i.e., updates the fields appropriately):

    <ul>
    
      <li>Modifies the current floor.

      <li>Modifies the direction of travel, if the ground floor or top
  floor has been reached.

      <li>Clears the array entry tracking the number of passengers destined
  for the floor that the elevator has just arrived at.

      <li>Clears the array entry indicating that a stop is required on
  the floor that the elevator has just arrived at.

    </ul>
    
  <li>Define a <font face="courier new"><b>boardPassenger(int floor)</b></font> method which adds to the elevator a
    passenger destined for the indicated floor.

  <li>Define a <font face="courier new"><b>toString()</b></font> method to aid in debugging and testing. The <font face="courier new"><b>String</b></font> returned by
    <font face="courier new"><b>toString()</b></font> should indicate the number of passengers on 
board, and the current floor.

</ul>

<p>This list defines <i>requirements</i> of the Elevator class. Your
submission should therefore define all the fields and methods
specified above, with appropriate access modes (private, public, etc.)
You are free to provide additional fields and methods that you find to
be useful.

<p>Note that there are two arrays tracking per-floor information, one
storing the number of passengers destined for a floor, and the other
storing a flag indicating whether the elevator needs to stop at a
floor. In this homework, the only reason to stop at a floor is that a
passenger wants to get off there. However, in future homeworks,
passengers on a floor who want to leave the building (for example)
will summon the elevator, and then the elevator must stop there, even
if nobody already on the elevator wants to stop there.

<h3>Testing</h3>

To demonstrate that your Elevator class is working properly, create an
<font face="courier new"><b>ElevatorTest</b></font> class in the package <font face="courier new"><b>cscie55.hw1.elevatortest</b></font>. The <font face="courier new"><b>main()</b></font>
method in this class should do the following:

  <ul>
    <li>Create an <font face="courier new"><b>Elevator</b></font> object.

    <li>Board two passengers for the 3nd floor, and one for the 5th floor.

    <li>Move the <font face="courier new"><b>Elevator</b></font> from the ground floor to the top floor, and
  then back to the ground floor.

    <li>Print the state of the elevator before the first move, and
  after each move. Your output should look like this:

<pre>
  Floor 1: 3 passengers
  Floor 2: 3 passengers
  Floor 3: 1 passenger
  Floor 4: 1 passenger
  Floor 5: 0 passengers
  Floor 6: 0 passengers
  Floor 7: 0 passengers
  Floor 6: 0 passengers
  Floor 5: 0 passengers
  Floor 4: 0 passengers
  Floor 3: 0 passengers
  Floor 2: 0 passengers
  Floor 1: 0 passengers
</pre>
  </ul>
