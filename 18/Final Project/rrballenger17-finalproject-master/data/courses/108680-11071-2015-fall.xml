            <exam_group>FAS18_G</exam_group>
            <notes>The first AAAS 209a class will be held on Wednesday, September 2 (as this is a Monday schedule) at 12pm (Locke Room, Barker 230). However, there will not be an evening section (6-8pm) on Wednesday September 2. The first 6-8pm evening section (African Studies Workshop) will take place September 14. The evening sessions will take place in Robinson Lower Level Library.  </notes>
            <description>In a story titled Africa Rising (2011), The Economist argued that the continent epitomizes both the &amp;quot;transformative promise of [capitalist ] growth and its bleakest dimensions.&amp;quot; This workshop will explore Africa&amp;#39;s changing place in the world - and the new economies, legalities, socialities, and cultural forms that have arisen there. It will also interrogate the claim that the African present is a foreshadowing of processes beginning to occur elsewhere; that, therefore, it is a productive source of theory about current conditions world-wide. The workshop, open to faculty and students, will meet Mondays from 6:00-7:30. 15 students will be permitted to take it as a course; they will also meet on Mondays, 12:00-1:30. Grades will be based on participation and a term essay.</description>
