            <description>We are an intensely social species. We have vast and complex social networks, connect with strangers for common goals, and gain a sense of identity through our &amp;quot;in group.&amp;quot; Understanding the human mind therefore means understanding how we influence and are influenced by the larger social web around us. In this course, we will examine empirical research that reveals how groups work -- how they can make us smarter or dumber, how we form social bonds, how the making of &amp;quot;us&amp;quot; also means the making of &amp;quot;them,&amp;quot; and how our social networks transmit everything from democracy to disease.</description>
