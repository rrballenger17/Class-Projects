            <description>This is an experiential learning course. The ensemble gives several concerts each year, sometimes joining with the chorus to perform large-scale works. Students are required to attend all rehearsals and certain special Saturday &amp;quot;retreats&amp;quot; announced in advance. Students are expected to practice the music outside the rehearsal time. Grades are based on attendance and participation.</description>
