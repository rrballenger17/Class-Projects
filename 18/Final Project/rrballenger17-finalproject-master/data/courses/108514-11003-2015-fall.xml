            <description>A seminar on aesthetics, or techniques for active noticing when writing about poetry, music and art. Derived from a Greek word for `perception,' aesthetics in the eighteenth century changed from the philosophical investigation of perception to meditation on art, according to such general concepts as `the beautiful' and `the sublime.' This course returns aesthetics to the field of perception by attending to details one does not normally see and deciding which are important. In addition to classroom work, there will be visits to Harvard and Boston museums. Students will write essays and keep a journal.</description>
