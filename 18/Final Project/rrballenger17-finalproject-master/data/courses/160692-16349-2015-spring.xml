            <description>Decision-Making and NegotiationPeople make decisions and negotiate with others from a young age; however, most know little about the strategy and the psychology that lie beneath these sophisticated behaviors. This class is designed to look &amp;lsquo;under the hood&amp;rsquo; at the cognitive processes at play when we make decisions and negotiate with others. We will discuss original research articles and use simulated class exercises to gain a better understanding of how the human mind makes choices and persuades others.</description>
