            <description>The history of sculpture is a story of constant recycling: forms are discarded, lost techniques rediscovered, and old materials are revived. This course will investigate the production of meaning through sculptural materials, their historic usage, and shifting cultural contexts.&amp;nbsp;Through hands-on experimentation, readings, projects, and lectures, we will explore a range of materials - from clay to plastics - and related methods.&amp;nbsp;Students will pursue their interests through research and development of individual projects.</description>
