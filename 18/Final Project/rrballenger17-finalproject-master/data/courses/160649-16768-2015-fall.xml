            <description>Analysis Through Action is a Russian method of converting the written word (e.g. a playtext or other source) into onstage action (live performance). Rooted in the last experiments of Konstantin Stanislavski, Analysis Through Action has evolved through generations of theatre practitioners and remains very much alive today in the Russian avant-garde theatre. With Anton Chekhov&amp;#39;s The Cherry Orchard as our master text, this laboratory will examine and deploy the two interdependent components of this process: in-depth text analysis and focused physical/vocal improvisations, called &amp;eacute;tudes. The course will consist of 40% lecture/seminar study and 60% improvisatory scene work. Weekly outside assignments will range from contextual readings to rigorous text analysis to preparing &amp;eacute;tudes for classroom rehearsals.</description>
