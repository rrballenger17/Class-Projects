Students will read a broad range of stories, poems and essays, as well as view films and videos that explore timeless, ever-resonant themes: love and loss, culture and identity, and tradition and rebellion in the Francophone world. Using these texts, students will study and reproduce various genres of written and spoken French (description, portrait, film critique, etc.)</description>
