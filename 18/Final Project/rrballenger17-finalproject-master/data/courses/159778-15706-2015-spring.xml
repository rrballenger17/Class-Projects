            <description>This studio course invites students to create projects using new genres media such as film, video, installation, performance, actions, time, protest, and other nontraditional processes. Projects using materials such as printmaking and sculpture are also encouraged. We will develop individual projects through discussions, arguments, visiting artists, and field trips. A history of conceptual and performance art from 1950-present will be traced. The goal is to emphasize the development of artistic ideas by broadening and challenging students&amp;rsquo; investigations.</description>
