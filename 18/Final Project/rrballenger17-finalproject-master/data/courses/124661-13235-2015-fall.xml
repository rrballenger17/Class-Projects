            <exam_group>FAS07_B</exam_group>
            <notes> No previous knowledge of Chinese required. This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past.</notes>
            <description>What makes a story prevail through time? We will visit the most beloved, enduring works in the Chinese tradition and discover cultural icons from the Handsome Monkey King to the Nobel prize-winning novel Soul Mountain. We will explore the cultural trends and themes that have been the stuff of popular Chinese novels, TV, cinema, and thought. This course offers a comprehensive, yet unique and unconventional window into Chinese tradition and modernity, past and present.</description>
