            <description>What did you eat today? The human diet has changed drastically over the course of evolutionary history. In this research seminar we will use a combination of lectures, discussions, and experiments to explore how modern, highly-processed diets have affected human chewing, cranio-dental growth, and energetics. Students will gain an appreciation for the ways that dietary changes have impacted human biology, as well as hands-on experience collecting diet data by using a variety of experimental techniques.</description>
