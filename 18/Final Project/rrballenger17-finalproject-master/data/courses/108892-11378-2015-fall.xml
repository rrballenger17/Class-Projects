            <description>How are the most personal choices and life transitions decided? When and whom do you marry, how many children do you have, how much education should you obtain, and which careers or jobs will you pursue? Much will be explored in terms of change over time, particularly concerning the economic emergence of women and the growing role of government. Readings draw on economic theory, empirical analyses, history, and literature from the 19th century to the present.</description>
