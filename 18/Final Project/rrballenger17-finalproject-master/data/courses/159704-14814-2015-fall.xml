            <description>The hippocampus encodes our spatial and temporal relationship with our environment. Hippocampal processing of space and time constructs our perception of context, the memories of our experiences, and our ability to imagine future possibilities. Without the hippocampus we would be stuck in the present moment. In this course we will study the genetic, physiological, and behavioral functions of the hippocampus. Students must complete both terms of this course(parts A and B) within the same academic year in order to receive credit.</description>
