            <description>In this introductory course about the Nouvelle Vague, students gain a unique perspective on French society, culture, and film in the 1950s and 1960s by studying the works of Jean-Luc Godard, Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Truffaut, &amp;Eacute;ric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette, and Claude Chabrol (among others). Students develop their writing and reading skills through film analysis and hone their speaking ability and listening comprehension through film screenings, examination of dialogue, and class discussions.</description>
