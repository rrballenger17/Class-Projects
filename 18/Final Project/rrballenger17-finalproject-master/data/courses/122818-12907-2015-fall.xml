            <description>Notions of topology have been invoked to clarify the properties of a variety of quantum systems and to classify the possible ground states of such systems.&amp;nbsp; We shall explore in depth examples such as integer and fractional quantized Hall states in two-dimensional systems, and topological insulators in two and three dimensions.&amp;nbsp; Discussions will include effects of disorder and localization phenomena, and practical issues of measurement that may have only marginal relation to topological concepts.</description>
