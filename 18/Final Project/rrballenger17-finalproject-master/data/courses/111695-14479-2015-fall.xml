            <exam_group>FAS03_A</exam_group>
            <notes> Course content overlaps substantially with Mathematics 21a, 25a,b, so students should plan to continue in Mathematics 23b.   This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning.</notes>
            <prereq>Recommended: Mathematics 1b or a grade of 4 or 5 on the Calculus BC Advanced Placement Examination, plus an interest both in proving mathematical results and in using them.</prereq>
            <description>Linear algebra: vectors, linear transformations and matrices, scalar and vector products, basis and dimension, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, including an introduction to the R scripting language. Single-variable real analysis: sequences and series, limits and continuity, derivatives, inverse functions, power series and Taylor series.&amp;nbsp; Multivariable real analysis and calculus: topology of Euclidean space, limits, continuity, and differentiation in n dimensions, inverse and implicit functions, manifolds, Lagrange multipliers, path integrals, div, grad, and curl.&amp;nbsp; Emphasis on topics that are applicable to fields such as physics, economics, and computer science, but students are also expected to learn how to prove key results.</description>
