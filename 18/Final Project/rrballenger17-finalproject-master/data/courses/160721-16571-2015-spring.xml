            <title short_title="SAS 131">South Asia: A Global History</title>
            <description>This course provides a global perspective on modern South Asia, from the early twentieth century to the present day. It examines how South Asia has shaped the world, and how the world has shaped South Asia. Topics covered will include: the Indian freedom movement in global perspective; the migration and settlement of South Asian communities overseas; conflict and cooperation between South Asia&amp;rsquo;s states&amp;mdash; India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka&amp;mdash;and relations between South Asia, China and the United States. We will also examine the centrality of South Asia to the successes and failures of schemes of international health and development, and to global environmental politics in the twenty first century.</description>
