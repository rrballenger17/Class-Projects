            <title short_title="MCB 353">Building Your Own Microscope</title>
            <description>Microscopes of various sorts are used by most biologists, who typically buy these off the shelf. With a little knowledge, however, most biologists can build their own microscopes to do many of the things that the commercial ones do. In this&amp;nbsp; quarter course, you will learn to build an epifluorescence microscope and to acquire images using a computer.</description>
