            <title short_title="HIST 1975">The History of Policing in the United States</title>
            <description>This course will investigate &amp;ldquo;the police power of the state&amp;rdquo; and its expression in the institutions called &amp;ldquo;the police.&amp;rdquo; We will inquire into the what, how, and why of policing, across a long sweep of US history, from the antebellum South to New York City of the 1990s. Students will engage with policing from a variety of angles, from social theory to legal and political history to popular culture. A key task of this course is to ask how the US history of race relations has intersected with the history of policing, including in key moments of crisis and transformation.</description>
