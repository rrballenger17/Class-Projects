            <title short_title="SOCWORLD 40">The Incas: The Last Great Empire of Pre-Columbian South America</title>
            <notes> This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past.</notes>
            <description>This course guides students on an exploration of the largest and most complex civilization of Pre-Columbian America$the Inca Empire of Andean South America. We will address such questions as how did a civilization emerge and thrive at 12,000 feet above sea level? How could a state-level society exist without markets, the wheel, or writing? In addition to lectures and discussions, students will experience the products of Inca civilization through hands-on study of artifacts in the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.</description>
