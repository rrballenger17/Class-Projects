            <description>Social movements are often considered a driving force behind political, social, and cultural change. This course explores the major theoretical and empirical approaches used in the social sciences to understand social movements. The course will examine a range of case studies including movements dealing with environmental justice, health, citizenship, and racial inclusion taken from a range of national contexts. Particular attention will be paid to transnational human rights and other activism.</description>
