            <title short_title="HAA 123N">Islam and Image</title>
            <description>A common stereotype is that Islam is against images, a deficit resulting from religious doctrine and endemic iconoclasm that in turn fostered the arts of writing and geometric abstraction without figuration. Such assertions are misleading and incomplete. The seminar looks at the broad scope of two-dimensional images produced throughout the Islamic lands from the formation of Islam in the seventh century to the present day. Selected case studies span diverse subject matters, media (from ink and watercolor to print and photography), functions, and contexts of use, and invite examination of a spectrum of formal operations and modalities of representation</description>
