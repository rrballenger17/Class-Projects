            <title short_title="HISTSCI 289">Entangled Objects: Or the Stuff of Science, Culture, and Society</title>
            <description>This course focuses on things: from Medieval reliquaries to the modern clocks and big data. Its aim is to look at objects from a variety of angles (science, anthropology, art, cultural studies) and to investigate what makes them such powerful anchors--actors--of our daily lives. The readings and discussions will provide a strong theoretical background to the final assignment: designing and mounting a temporary exhibit.&amp;nbsp;</description>
