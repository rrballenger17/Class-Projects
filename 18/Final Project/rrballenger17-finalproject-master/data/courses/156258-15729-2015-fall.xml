            <exam_group>FAS01_A</exam_group>
            <description>This course focuses on the American Catholic experience. We will discuss French and Spanish missions, Catholic immigration to the British colonies, the rise of nativism, and controversies over slavery, industrial capitalism, "Americanism," feminism, war, and sexuality. We will also discuss the transformation of the Catholic Church in the wake of Vatican II and contemporary divisions between "liberals" and "conservatives." Besides examining Catholic intellectual life, we will also explore Catholic popular religion and devotionalism. Throughout the course, we will focus on the historical development of the Catholic Church and the relationship between Catholics and American culture.</description>
