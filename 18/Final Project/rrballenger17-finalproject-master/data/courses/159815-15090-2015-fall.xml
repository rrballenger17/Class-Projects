            <description>Scholars have noted the connection between environment and specific forms of Asian politics and society. Today China reengineers the flow of its rivers to address social demands for water. South &amp;amp; Southeast Asian polities realize how politics beyond their borders can determine the flow of the region&amp;#39;s rivers--and thus the health of their societies. The dangers of poor air quality, polluted land, and contaminated food energize social movements and unrest.&amp;nbsp; Asian development models have resulted in extreme pollution, and with resulting public health problems, governmental attention to the environment has increased. In this research seminar students will explore &amp;quot;politics and environment&amp;quot; in Asia, with some attention being given to the future.</description>
