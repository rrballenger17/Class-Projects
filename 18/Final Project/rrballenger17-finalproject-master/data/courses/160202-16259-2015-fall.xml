            <description>H.P. Lovecraft, the American writer of science fiction, horror, and fantasy, created a cosmology, a mythology,&amp;nbsp; and an alternative vision of life and reality so compelling that over the years some readers have come to believe that his invented Necronomicon is a real book (in the Widener stacks). Like his predecessor, Edgar Allan Poe, Lovecraft lived and died without recognition in his own country: American culture then as now valued practicality and social engagement.&amp;nbsp; What is it, then, that captivates Lovecraftians? The seminar will explore the invention of personal mythologies, languages, and narratives of counter-realities by Lovecraft and other writers (including Poe, C.G. Jung, Ursula Le Guin, Colin Wilson, and Philip K. Dick) as ways of individuation, and of resistance to conformity, through creative imagination. &amp;nbsp;</description>
