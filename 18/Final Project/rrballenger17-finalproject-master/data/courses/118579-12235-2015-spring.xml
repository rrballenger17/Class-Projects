            <description>There has been a shift from the traditional notion of art work to the idea of art project. The art project could be understood as a concept structured in a constellation of different but independent elements, which the author is able to master not only the implicit creative aspects but also a certain social dimension. We will deal with the sequential steps of a photography project: creative conception, documentation, practical realization, and critical evaluation.</description>
