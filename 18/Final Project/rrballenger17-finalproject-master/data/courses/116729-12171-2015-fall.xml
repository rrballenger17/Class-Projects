            <description>This course is an introduction to the major achievements, developments, and ideas in Greek culture, from the Bronze Age to the 4th Century BCE. We will examine this inventive and tumultuous period through weekly readings in epic, lyric and dramatic poetry, history, biography, and philosophy, as well as visual images. All readings will be done in English translation. Our aim is both to try to understand this distant culture in its own sociopolitical context, and to trace its relationship to subsequent developments in Western civilization.</description>
