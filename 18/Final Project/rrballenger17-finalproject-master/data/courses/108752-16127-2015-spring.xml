            <title short_title="SPANSH 194">The Borges Machine</title>
            <notes> Conducted in Spanish.</notes>
            <description>We study Jorge Luis Borges's poetry, short stories, and essays; from Fervor de Buenos Aires to El Aleph; from his scripts and the films based on them to the cultural constellations that rose around him, as well as those his work created. We will think of Borges as a writer, but also as literary machine, an artifice that produces meaning in the works of other writers and in cultural formations beyond Argentina and Latin America.</description>
