            <description>This course examines the role of riots and uprisings in social, economic, and political change. &amp;nbsp;Twenty-first century governance has been characterized by a fracturing of state sovereignty and economic crisis in many parts of the globe, which have given rise to new forms of collective action, configurations of labor, and understandings of the material world. &amp;nbsp;We ask how activist networks, crowds, and insurgencies are reshaping long-standing distinctions between law and illegality, privacy and publicity, formal and informal markets, state and non-state spaces, especially under conditions of stark inequality. &amp;nbsp;Through contemporary theory, ethnography, and digital media methods, we focus on unrest over health, safety, and the environment.</description>
