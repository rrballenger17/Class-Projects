            <description>In Proust's novel, A la recherche du temps perdu, questions of time and memory, truth and signification, literature and philosophy converge to ask: who am I? What does it mean to become a writer? Readings include selections from each tome of the novel and significant critical texts. Offered in conjunction with the interdisciplinary conference "Proust and the Arts" (April 2013). Students will attend related exhibits and performances, and may submit a creative final project.</description>
