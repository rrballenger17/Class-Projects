            <description>What is historical method, and in what sense might history be made a science? Proposed answers to these questions have varied over time, in part according to changing conceptions of science and its methods. Course topics will include concepts of the event, agency, and causation; the constitution and use of archives; quantitative approaches to history; values of objectivity and completeness; and big history. Emphasis, not exclusive, on how historians of science have approached these historiographical problems.&amp;nbsp;</description>
