            <description>This studio course uses new genres media as a springboard for mixing time-based and object-based concerns. During the semester we will work with&amp;nbsp;both ephemeral and physical materials, creating artworks that blend performance, sculpture and drawing. Projects exploring poetry, literature, intermedia and emerging art forms are also invited. Works by artists such as VALIE EXPORT and Bruce Nauman will be introduced as we discuss topics as intention, subject matter, and autobiography.</description>
