            <description>This course examines a range of works from the British and American LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) canon. Our starting premise will be that LGBT themes have been central, rather than peripheral, to the Western literary tradition. We&amp;#39;ll pay close attention to how sexual identity, gender identity, sex, and desire are understood and represented in different social and historical circumstances, as well as the aesthetic traditions and personal experiences shaping these individual works. Authors include James Baldwin, E.M. Forster, Nella Larsen, and Audre Lorde.</description>
