            <description>How do our brains give rise to our minds? Specifically, how are mental processes related to neural activity? This course will explore these questions, as well as the methods by which cognitive neuroscience seeks to answer them. We will focus on processes within perception, attention, memory, language, action, emotion, and social cognition, and methods including neuroimaging, neuropsychology, and electrophysiology.</description>
