            <description>This course provides an introduction to the visual system and its assessment. In general, we will consider vision as a system rather than its low-level components. Each two-hour session consists of two lectures provided by faculty with expertise in that area. Topics will include basic science and clinical topics, normal vision and abnormal vision, methods of assessment of animals and humans, clinical and laboratory measures.</description>
