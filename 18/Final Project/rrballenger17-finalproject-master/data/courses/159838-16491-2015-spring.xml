            <description>Psychoactive molecules are commonplace in today&amp;#39;s world.&amp;nbsp; Examples range from the widely used and familiar - caffeine and sugar - to the illegal -&amp;nbsp; heroin and MDMA/Ecstasy/Molly, and severlal of the illegal ones have legitimate uses as treatments for pain (heroin) or possibly post -traumatic stress disorder (MDMA).&amp;nbsp; The seminar focuses on neurotransmitters, the molecules that allow individual neurons in our brains to communicate with each other and form the networks that define who we are and how we interact with the world around us.&amp;nbsp; We will explore how psychoactive molecules alter neuronal communication for better or worse. &amp;ensp;</description>
