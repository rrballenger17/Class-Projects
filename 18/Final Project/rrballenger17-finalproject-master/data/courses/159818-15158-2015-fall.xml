            <description>The idea that transparency, or truth in politics, is both an unequivocally good objective, and an attainable one, is now commonplace. The modern period of political thought, by contrast, presents startlingly different evaluations of, and approaches to, transparency. &amp;nbsp;Drawing on the work of Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Rousseau, this course explores the politics of verity and falsity as each relates to questions of 1) epistemology 2) methodology and 3) rhetoric. &amp;nbsp;In so doing, the course offers a historical lens through which to reconsider, and potentially critique, contemporary notions of political transparency. &amp;nbsp;</description>
