            <description>This course investigates the central problems of political theory that concern the justification of democracy. Is democratic rule the uniquely just form of collective decision-making? What political institutions best express the democratic values of equality, deliberation, and participation? What are the moral responsibilities of citizens - whose representatives exercise political power in their name? Is democracy a human right? Readings integrate contemporary work in political philosophy with canonical thinkers, including Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, and J.S. Mill.</description>
