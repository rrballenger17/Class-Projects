            <description>To be run concurrently with Genetics 390qc. Students will have the opportunity to design experimental approaches that aim to answer specific questions in the field of genetics. Combined with the hands-on laboratory experience of Genetics 390qc, students will use their knowledge of experimental methods and data analysis with a variety of model organisms and techniques. Over the two-week course period, students will be asked to reflect daily on their experiences and design two unique experiments that will broaden their experience in the areas of hypothesis testing and data interpretation.</description>
