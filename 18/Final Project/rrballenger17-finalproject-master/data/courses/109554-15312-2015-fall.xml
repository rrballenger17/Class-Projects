            <description>Introduces students to politics and political change in Latin America's largest country. Outlines historical perspectives and contemporary challenges, and examines political institutions, civil society, and contemporary politics and policy. Emphasis is on how institutional change, decentralization, and the mobilization of civil society have interacted to change the trajectory of Brazilian politics by deepening citizen participation, strengthening political parties and political representation, reforming social policy, guaranteeing citizenship rights, and ultimately reducing inequality and deepening democracy.</description>
