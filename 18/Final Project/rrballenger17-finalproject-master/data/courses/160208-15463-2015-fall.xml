            <description>A studio course considering the possibility of sculpture to be autonomous in different contexts, ranging from the moment when an object is liberated from its original circumstances of production to its continuing life and how it might reflect on new situations.&amp;nbsp; Using a variety of materials, including &amp;quot;found footage&amp;quot;, we will investigate the sculptural qualities of an environment, and consider the roles that reality and immediacy can play in artistic procedure.
