            <description>Medicines and other therapeutics have revolutionized the treatment of many diseases. Few of us pause to consider how these products are developed from an initial discovery in the lab to the treatment of patients. This course will consider this journey by incorporating scientific, biotechnology, intellectual property, venture capital, and business perspectives. In addition to lectures, students will work on group projects to chart a strategy toward bringing a novel biomedical idea to the clinic.</description>
