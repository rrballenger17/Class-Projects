            <description>Titled after Phillip Guston, this course has two agendas: technical assignments that improve your ability to move paint around, and laying conceptual groundwork for personal projects. One task of an artist is to have a relationship with a world. From the vantage of individual studios, we will discuss the boundaries between interior and exterior discourse, as well as the social role of artists and the artist&amp;rsquo;s voice through self-expression as well as abnegation&amp;mdash;auteurs, flaneurs, and ventriloquists.&amp;nbsp;</description>
