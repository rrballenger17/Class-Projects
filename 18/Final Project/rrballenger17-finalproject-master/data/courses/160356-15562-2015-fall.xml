            <description>Social networks consist of relationships that carry information, mediate trade, and facilitate cooperation. Online platforms generate &amp;quot;big data&amp;quot; records of what is going on in such networks at unprecedented levels of detail. How do we make sense of the data, and how can we use it to make decisions&amp;mdash;as individuals, within companies, and as a society? This seminar teaches models from the economics and statistics of networks that are essential to the task. Topics include ideas going viral, online markets, and social influence. Students will complete a final project that either develops an original model or applies an existing one to analyze real-world data.</description>
