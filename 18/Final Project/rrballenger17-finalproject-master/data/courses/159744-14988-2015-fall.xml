            <description>What, if anything, do we owe to the other animals, and why?&amp;nbsp; Do the other animals have a moral nature, and does it matter to how we treat them whether they do? What can we learn about human morality by thinking about animals?&amp;nbsp; Should or could animals have legal rights? We will consider some answers to these questions, including utilitarian and Kantian approaches and others.</description>
