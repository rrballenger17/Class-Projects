            <description>This course develops abilities in using analytic frameworks in the formulation and assessment of public policies. It considers a variety of analytic techniques, particularly those directed toward uncertainty and interactive decision problems. It emphasizes the application of techniques to policy analysis, not formal derivations. Students encounter case studies, methodological readings, modeling of current events, the computer, a final exam, and challenging problem sets.</description>
