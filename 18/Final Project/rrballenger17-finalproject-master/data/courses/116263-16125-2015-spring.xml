            <description>Introduces students to central debates and problems that have shaped Latin American culture. We address questions of cultural identity, gender, race, politics, economics and aesthetics by looking at historical and literary texts, films, visual arts and urban development from an interdisciplinary perspective. We analyze colonial encounters; revolutions; US-Latin American relations; popular cultures from tango and samba to football and carnaval; Latin American cities and slums; and memory, trauma and traces of the region's dictatorships.</description>
