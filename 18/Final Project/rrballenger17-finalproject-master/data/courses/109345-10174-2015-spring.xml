            <description>Synthetic biology is a new discipline that seeks to enable the predictable engineering of biological systems. According to one conception of synthetic biology, proteins and genetic regulatory elements are modular and can be combined in a predictable manner. In practice however, assembled genetic devices do not function as expected. The purpose of the course is to go beyond the textbook, first-pass description of molecular mechanisms and focus on details that are specifically relevant to engineering biological systems.</description>
