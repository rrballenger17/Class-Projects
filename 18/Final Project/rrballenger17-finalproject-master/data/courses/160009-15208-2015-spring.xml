            <title short_title="ENGLISH 221C">Editing Pore Caitif: Seminar</title>
            <description>Houghton Library MS Eng 701 is a fifteenth-century copy of a major religious compilation, Pore Caitif, written to teach its lay readers &amp;quot;the right way to heaven without multiplication of many books.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Working together and acquiring the necessary skills along the way, we will prepare and submit for publication a scholarly edition of this work.&amp;nbsp; We will also consider its wider place in the intellectual and spiritual culture of its period, primarily by way of a study of other manuscripts in which it is found.</description>
