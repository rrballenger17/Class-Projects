            <description>	Is morality found or made? Every belief comes from someplace and somewhere, but we rarely think this affects its truth. Is morality neatly separable from the pathways and contexts thanks to which it comes to our attention? Taking contemporary human rights norms, laws, and movements as a case study, this course examines this question. We will study where human rights norms come from, the history of international organizations, and how non-governmental actors came to defend human rights. The relationship of human rights to the histories of governance, empire, warfare, emotions, and victimhood will be taken up.</description>
