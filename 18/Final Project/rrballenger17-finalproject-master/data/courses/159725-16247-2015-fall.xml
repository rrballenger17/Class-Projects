            <description>This seminar will focus on landmark works of fiction (in English) that grapple with&amp;nbsp; individual experiences and social consequences of major wars involving the U.S.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Military confrontations are immensely destructive but, as human enterprises, they also produce culture.&amp;nbsp; The seminar will investigate how modern soldiers have represented the aims and outcomes of the field of war in fiction.&amp;nbsp; More inclusively, it will examine both the intentional and unintentional cultural work of war. The seminar&amp;#39;s title is deliberately ambiguous, also allowing for the implication that nations construct fictions about aims or enemies in order to galvanize their people to wage war.</description>
