            <description>This quarter course will offer students an in-depth examination of current knowledge regarding mechanisms of cell fate decisions.&amp;nbsp; In addition, it will examine these processes in the context of developmental cell plasticity, cellular reprogramming, and cancer.&amp;nbsp; This will primarily be a literature-based course with examination and discussion of key studies in the field.&amp;nbsp; Concepts involving the instructive role of lineage-specific transcription factors, transcription factor networks, transcription factor cross-antagonism, feedback loops, multilineage priming, pioneer factors, epigenetics, chromatin remodeling factors, &amp;ldquo;super enhancers&amp;rdquo;, stem cell bias, lineage identity maintenance, mitotic bookmarking, non-coding RNAs, cell polarity, asymmetric cell division, Notch signaling, lateral inhibition, lineage plasticity, and cellular reprogramming will be explored.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; These ideas will be examined in the context of a number of different tissue systems and organisms.</description>
