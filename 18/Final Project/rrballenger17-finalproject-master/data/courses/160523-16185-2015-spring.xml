            <title short_title="MCB 355">Visualizing, Analyzing and Presenting Macromolecular Structures with PyMOL</title>
            <description>PyMOL is one of the most popular software programs to display and explore high-resolution structures of macromolecules. It is readily used to create publication-quality figures, and movies and animations of structural information. In this course, you will learn the basics of PyMOL and be able to display, explore and present three-dimensional structures of macromolecules. With this basic training, you will be able to generate high-quality images and simple movies, and have the resources to learn more on your own to generate more complex displays.</description>
