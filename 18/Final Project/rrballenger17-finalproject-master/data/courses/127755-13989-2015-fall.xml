            <description>This course will focus on the metabolic reprogramming of cells as they undergo the transformation from normal to cancer cells. Emphasis will be placed on the unique nutrient and energy demands of growing tumors, the molecular mechanisms by which oncogenic signaling pathways alter cellular metabolism, and therapeutic opportunities arising from the profound differences in the metabolism of normal versus tumor cells. This course consists of one lecture and one session of critical reading of current primary literature related to the lecture each week.</description>
