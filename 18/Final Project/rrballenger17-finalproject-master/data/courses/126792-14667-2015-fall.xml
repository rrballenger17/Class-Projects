            <description>This course examines the processes by which theologians study theologies across religious boundaries, bringing this learning into dialogue with home traditions, by careful comparison, dialogical reflection, and, ideally, a well-informed theological understanding of what it means to belong to one tradition and learn from another. Readings include (by way of example) Hindu primary texts and texts from the Roman Catholic traditions, but students are encouraged to bring their knowledge of and interest in other traditions to the discussions.</description>
