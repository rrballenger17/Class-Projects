            <prereq>Recommended: Mathematics 1b is a prerequisite, although it can be taken concurrently. Some limited concepts from Mathematics 21a / Applied Mathematics 21a will be used, but they can be learned during the course. The course provides an introduction to programming with a mathematical focus, and starts from the level of a complete beginner; in the past, some students have found Computer Science 50 helpful, although this is not required.</prereq>
