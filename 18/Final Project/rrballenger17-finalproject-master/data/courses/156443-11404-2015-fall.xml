            <description>International migrations constantly reshape politics, markets and societies. They generate challenges and opportunities for people, communities, businesses, civil society organizations, political parties, governments and international institutions. This course examines the political, social and economic consequences of migrations around the world, in both sending and receiving countries. We will study the impact of migration on citizenship, sovereignty, political regimes and platforms, economic development, inequality, human capital, as well as on political values and participation.</description>
