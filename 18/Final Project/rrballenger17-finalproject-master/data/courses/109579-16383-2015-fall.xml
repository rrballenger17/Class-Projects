The course will meet twice per week, and each module will be comprised of a stand-alone topic with a single homework assignment. Enrolled students will be required to sign up for the full year and attend half of the offered modules. Students must complete both parts of this course (parts A and B) within the same academic year in order to receive credit.	&amp;nbsp;</description>
