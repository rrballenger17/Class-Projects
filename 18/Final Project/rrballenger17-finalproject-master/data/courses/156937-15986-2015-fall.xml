            <prereq>Recommended: Life Sciences 1a or Life and Physical Sciences A or permission of the instructor; Mathematics at the level of Math 19a or statistics at the level of Stat 102 or above. CS 50 or some previous exposure to programming is preferred but not required.</prereq>
            <description>This course is a hands-on introduction to computational analysis of RNA sequencing data as a measure of genome-wide transcription. We will cover methods spanning the spectrum of RNA-Seq analysis: starting from raw sequencing reads, obtaining gene expression measures, and interpreting biological significance by differential expression analyses, clustering, and visualization. Coursework will consist of programming assignments in Pythonexploring real datasets. The course will emphasize skills applicable to independent biological research.</description>
