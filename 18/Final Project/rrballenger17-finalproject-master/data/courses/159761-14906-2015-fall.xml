            <description>This studio course aims to further basic drawing skills with intention and purpose while expanding how we see the world around us.&amp;nbsp;Using&amp;nbsp;conventional drawing methods as a starting point, we will explore the potential of depicting&amp;nbsp;space,&amp;nbsp;both literally and metaphorically. Examining landscape, objects, buildings and interiors, students are encouraged to consider their relationship to the physical, conceptual and emotional spaces they inhabit. Finding&amp;nbsp;inspiration from both contemporary art practices and architecture itself, assignments will delve into abstract and conceptual principles, and introduce specialized systems of rendering and notation.&amp;nbsp;</description>
