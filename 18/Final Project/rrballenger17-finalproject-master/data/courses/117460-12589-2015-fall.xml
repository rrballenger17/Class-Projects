            <description>A course developing the actor's approach to and playing of comedy and humor. The class will focus on marrying comedy's need for technical precision with a truthful and spontaneous approach to acting based on the methodology of Konstantin Stanislavski. Specific comic skills studied will include timing, focus, choreography, and the mechanics of how a joke builds from set up to punchline. Acting skills will focus on moment to moment pursuit of objective and creation of character. Styles of comedy will include farce, drawing room/comedy of manners and contemporary comic playwriting such as David Lindsay-Abaire, Nicky Silver, Christopher Durang and Sarah Ruhl.</description>
