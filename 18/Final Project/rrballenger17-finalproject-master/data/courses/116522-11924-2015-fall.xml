            <exam_group>FAS12_F</exam_group>
            <notes> By permission only. The class is open to third year (or higher) social anthropology students who have done most of the background reading for a major research project and are actively working on a formal research proposal, of which they have a draft in hand. For most students, this will be a proposal for their PhD dissertation research. Students in their second year may be eligible to take the course in certain circumstances.</notes>
            <description>This course is a practicum designed to help students craft effective research and grant proposals, learn how to constructively critique others&amp;rsquo; proposals, and develop enduring collaborative relationships. Many writing problems are fundamentally thinking and design problems. For this reason, conceptual structure, project design, and methodological choices will occupy a great deal of our time. The first half of the semester will focus on Wenner-Gren-type proposals, the second half on proposals for the National Science Foundation and similar funders.&amp;nbsp;</description>
