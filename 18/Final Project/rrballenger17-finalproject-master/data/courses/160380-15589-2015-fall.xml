            <description>This year-long research seminar explores American capitalism as an historical form of political economy, developed over three centuries.&amp;nbsp; In association with the Warren Center fellows&amp;rsquo; workshop on the same theme, the inquiry will extend the history of the American economy so as to include a cross-disciplinary endeavor including the sociology of knowledge, the study of technology and material culture, changing paradigms of political authority, the re-organization of family life, the invention of the modern private subject, and the birth of liberal ideology.&amp;nbsp;Students must complete both terms of this course (parts A and B) within the same academic year in order to receive credit.</description>
