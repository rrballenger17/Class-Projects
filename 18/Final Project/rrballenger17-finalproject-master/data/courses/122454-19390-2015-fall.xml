            <description>Performers and Composers in Early Modern Europe. This course studies the relationship between improvised polyphony and written works by composers from Josquin des Prez and Claudio Monteverdi to Arcangelo Corelli. Techniques examined include improvised canons, stretto fuga, fauxbourdon, bass patterns, and partimento. This hands-on, performerly perspective facilitates a series of reflections on the status of composers, singers, instrumentalists, and written &amp;quot;works&amp;quot; in histories of the period.</description>
