            <description>What can we know; how can we know it? Can I know that I am not a brain in a vat being manipulated into thinking that I have a body? Can I know that Lincoln was assassinated, that electrons have negative charge, that Hamlet is a masterpiece, that the sun will rise tomorrow? This seminar will study skeptical arguments and responses to them to explore the nature and scope of knowledge.</description>
