            <description>Explores early modern ways of depicting and showing violence (physical, political, domestic, supernatural). The spectacle of violence represents a site of cultural conflict during the 17th century, since it implies both the pleasure taken by the viewer and the risk of imitation. Readings include plays, tragic histories, utopian and travel literature, historical and theoretical texts (Foucault, RanciÃ¨re, Marin, Elias, Lyotard), and the analysis of images (paintings, frontispieces).</description>
