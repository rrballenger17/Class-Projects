            <prereq>Course open to Freshman Students Only</prereq>
            <description>Reads classical waka, its modern descendant the tanka, and examples of linked verse (renga) and modern poems in free and prose-poem forms. (And haiku too!) Focuses on themes such as desire, renunciation, time, memory, war, death, sorrow, and receptivity. Students keep a diary of their encounters with the new poetry, practice the art of sequencing, and make their own translations based on literal renderings and explanations of Japanese originals.</description>
