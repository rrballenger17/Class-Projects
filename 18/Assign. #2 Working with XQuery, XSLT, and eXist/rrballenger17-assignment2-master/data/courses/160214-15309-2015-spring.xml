            <description>This course introduces students to the history and practice of performance art, social practice and event-based art making.&amp;nbsp; Starting with our own bodies, and working outward through texts, sites, histories, and fictions, we will complete short gestural exercises, write and interpret scores, and develop situation-specific projects.&amp;nbsp; This course will introduce movements and artists including the Futurists, Black Mountain College, Allan Kaprow, the Gutai Group, Womanhouse, and many more. Experimentation, collaboration, and participation will be encouraged.</description>
