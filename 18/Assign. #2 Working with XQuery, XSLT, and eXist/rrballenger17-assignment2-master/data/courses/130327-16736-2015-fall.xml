            <description>You've designed your experiment, made your measurements, and analyzed your data. Now what? How do you write a paper that will not only get accepted, but also get cited? This is a hands-on workshop course targeted at graduate students who are ready to write up their first research paper for submission to a peer-reviewed scientific journal. The class will emphasize the idea that your paper should tell a (nonfiction!) story that engages the reader. By the end of the semester you will have a coherent, well-structured, and polished manuscript.</description>
