            <description>Portrait, person, effigy, model, anatomy, subject, self&amp;mdash;the body is often central in art. This course will examine many ways of approaching the human figure through painting. Working first from life, we will also consider the body in media, in horror, in history and in absentia;Ã‚&#160; as politics, as sexuality, as identity and as idea.  </description>
