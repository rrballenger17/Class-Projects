            <title short_title="FRENCH 148C">Performing in French: A Production of a Modern Tragedy</title>
            <prereq>Prerequisite: French 61c OR French 61g OR French 61h OR French 61m OR French 71a</prereq>
            <description>This course focuses on the preparation of a student-led production of a contemporary French play, and concludes with a performance in French at the end of the semester. To react to the challenges we will face in staging a "modern tragedy", we will examine the diversity of tragic forms and motifs since the 17th century up to our days through the close readings of a given set of plays, as well as the main trends in the contemporary staging, through the viewing and discussion of video versions of recent productions.</description>
