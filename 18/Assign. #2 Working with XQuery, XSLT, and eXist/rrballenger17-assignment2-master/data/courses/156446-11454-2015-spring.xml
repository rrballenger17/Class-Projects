            <title short_title="GOV 94YM">The Politics of Climate Change</title>
            <notes>Cheryl Welch and Yascha Mounk  </notes>
            <description>This course examines the political challenges posed by global warming from both an empirical and a normative perspective. Drawing on a broad array of readings, we investigate why the global community has done so little to combat climate change; what kinds of domestic and international institutions we need to coordinate our response to global warming; whether we should prioritize mitigation or adaptation; and what a just response to climate change might look like.</description>
