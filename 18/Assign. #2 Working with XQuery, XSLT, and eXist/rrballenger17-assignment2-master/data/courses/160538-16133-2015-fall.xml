            <description>The ability to sequence genomes from ancient remains is revolutionizing our understanding of past human behavior. This seminar will focus on what genome-wide studies of modern and ancient DNA have already shown, the tensions that have arisen between genetics and other disciplines, and possible ways to reconcile these tensions.&amp;nbsp; Enrollment will be limited to 15, chosen to represent a balance of disciplines touched on by the new data. Prospective students should submit a one-page essay explaining their interest in the course and the critical perspective that they expect to bring.</description>
