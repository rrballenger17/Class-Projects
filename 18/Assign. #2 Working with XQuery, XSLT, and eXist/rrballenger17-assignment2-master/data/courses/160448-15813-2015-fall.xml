            <notes> Engineering Sciences 254 is also offered as Applied Mathematics 254.  Students may not take both for credit.</notes>
            <prereq>Recommended: Analysis (Math 21a/b, or equivalent), Probability (Statistics 110, Engineering Sciences 150, or equivalent).</prereq>
            <description>This course introduces students to several fundamental notions and methods in statistical physics that have been successfully applied to the analysis of various problems in signal processing, information theory, and theoretical computer science. Discussions will be focused on studying such information processing systems in the infinite-size limit, on analyzing the emergence of phase transitions, and on understanding the behaviors of efficient algorithms. This course seeks to start from basics, assuming just undergraduate probability and analysis, and in particular assuming no knowledge of statistical physics. Students will take an active role by applying what they learn from the course to their preferred applications.</description>
