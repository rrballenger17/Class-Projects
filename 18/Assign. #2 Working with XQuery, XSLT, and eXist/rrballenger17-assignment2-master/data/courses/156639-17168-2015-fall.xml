            <description>As social beings, humans have a fundamental need to affiliate and bond with each other. In this course, we will trace social relationships across the human lifespan, from parent-infant attachment to adolescent peer relationships to pair bonding in adulthood. In doing so, we will discuss the evolutionary benefits of this social motive and the dissolution of social bonds. We will also examine current issues in psychological science especially relevant to social bonds, including online relationships and the role of oxytocin.</description>
