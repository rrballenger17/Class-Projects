            <description>This course explores the causes of war. It examines the different theories that have been devised to explain organized violence between states (or groups seeking to control a state), and evaluates these competing theories by exploring several major conflicts of the past 100 years: World War I, World War II, the Cold War, the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the recent wars in the Persian Gulf. The course also considers the phenomenon of ethnic conflict, the implications of nuclear weapons and the question of whether large-scale war is becoming "obsolescent."</description>
