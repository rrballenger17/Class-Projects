            <description>Disease and healing pose pragmatic and moral challenges for individuals and societies. Artists and writers have struggled to make sense of these tragic and transcendent experiences through fiction, poetry, art, and music. Scholars can explore these archives of the illness experience to understand not just disease and medicine but also what it means to be human. This interdisciplinary course examines how the medical humanities can change how we think about suffering, resilience, and care-giving, an endeavor relevant to anyone who expects to encounter these problems in life (i.e., everyone). In 2015 the course will focus on epidemics; case studies may include plague, tuberculosis, cancer, AIDS, SARS, and Ebola. Future offerings might address chronic disease, mental illness, death and dying, or caregiving.</description>
