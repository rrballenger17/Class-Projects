            <prereq>Course open to Freshman Students Only</prereq>
            <description>Marketing is the process by which an organization creates value for customers and extracts a share of that value for the organization. The seminar will cover the basics of marketing management and explore how the advent of new digital technologies, the increasingly global nature of business, and recent societal trends are impacting the marketing field. The seminar draws upon concepts in psychology, sociology and economics and infuses many examples to illustrate relevant issues. Each meeting covers a specific topic, with pre-readings forming the basis for in-class discussion. There will be two short assignments during the term and one final paper.</description>
