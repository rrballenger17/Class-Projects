            <description>This course explores state-of-the-art research, tools and measurements used to investigate and predict climate change through ongoing studies at the Harvard Forest's 3,500 acre outdoor laboratory in Petersham, MA. The seminar consists of four weekend-long field trips (Friday evening-Sunday) to the Harvard Forest and a final on-campus meeting. Students develop skills for evaluating, discussing, and presenting the ecological evidence for climate change, including feedbacks between forests and the atmosphere and long-term impacts on forest ecosystems.</description>
