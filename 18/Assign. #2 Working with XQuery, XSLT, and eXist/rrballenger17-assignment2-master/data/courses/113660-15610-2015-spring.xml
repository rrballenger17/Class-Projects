            <description>Big data is everywhere. A fundamental goal across numerous modern businesses and sciences is to be able to exploit as many machines as possible, to consume as much information as possible and as fast as possible. The big challenge is "how to turn data into useful knowledge". This is far from a simple task and a moving target as both the underlying hardware and our ability to collect data evolve. In this class, we will discuss how to design data systems and algorithms that can "scale up" and "scale out". Scale up refers to the ability to use a single machine to all its potential, i.e., to exploit properly the memory hierarchy and the multiple CPU and GPU cores. Scale out refers to the ability to use more than 1 machines (typically 100s or 1000s) effectively. This is a research oriented class. Every week we will read two modern research papers; one from the scale up area and one from the scale out area. We will use examples from several areas, including relational systems and distributed databases, graph processing systems (i.e., for social networks), key value stores, noSQL and newSQL systems as well as mobile computing. Each student will work on a semester long data systems research project (in groups of 2-4 students) which can be in any of the above areas and will be based on an open research problem.</description>
