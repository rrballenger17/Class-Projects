            <notes> Enrollment limited to 15.</notes>
            <description>This course will introduce recent theories of masculinity and performativity in gender theory with the aim of exploring possible links to medical and public health constructions of the male body and men&amp;rsquo;s health. From 19th century concerns about degeneration and the identification of &amp;ldquo;effete&amp;rdquo; male to the military&amp;rsquo;s failed policy of &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t ask, don&amp;rsquo;t tell,&amp;rdquo; we will consider the various ways cultural anxieties about &amp;ldquo;manliness&amp;rdquo; have been addressed by medical, psychological, and public health experts. Topical areas will include: risk taking, sports, body image, sexuality, violence, depression, ADHD, sociopathy, suicide, aging and life expectancy.</description>
