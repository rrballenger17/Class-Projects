            <description>An advanced language course for Spanish heritage learners that aims to: strengthen students&amp;rsquo; oral and written linguistic range, with emphasis on Spanish use for academic contexts; and to further develop students&amp;rsquo; critical language and social awareness around important issues for Latinos in our globalized era: Spanish as global language, identity, language rights, global migration and labor, U.S.-Latino America relations, food and environment, the &amp;rsquo;war on drugs&amp;rsquo;. Students explore these topics through various genres (newspapers and academic articles, debates, literary essays, short novels, poetry, visual art, film and music) and through 4 hours a week of community service.</description>
