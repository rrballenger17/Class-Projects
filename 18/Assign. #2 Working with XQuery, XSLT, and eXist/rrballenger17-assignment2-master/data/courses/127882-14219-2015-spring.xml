            <description>Texts become prompts for art-making in this class. By inspiring painting, dance, play, music, sculpture, costumes, texts lead to deep and daring interpretations. Latin American classics that might otherwise seem difficult become raw material for creativity as students stretch their command of Spanish. They learn that arts interpret and explore meanings and that theory is a user-friendly afterthought. This training prepares facilitation of Pre-Texts workshops in Boston and abroad.</description>
