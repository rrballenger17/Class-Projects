            <title short_title="HIST 1048">Medieval Britain and Ireland, c. AD 800-1600</title>
            <description>This course provides an overview of the development of societies in Britain and Ireland from the Viking Age to the Reformation (c. AD 800-1600), using evidence from archaeology, buildings and iconography. Coverage includes: the impact of the Scandinavians; the West Saxon Kingdom of England, the Hiberno-Norse kingdoms of Ireland and the polities of Wales and Scotland; the Norman Conquests of the 11th and 12th centuries; and the development of near-global networks in the &amp;lsquo;Old World&amp;rsquo; in the later medieval period, culminating in the Black Death and its aftermath. The course finishes with the Reformation and the birth of Atlantic empires.</description>
