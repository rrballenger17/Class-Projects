            <notes> This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Societies of the World or Culture and Belief, but not both. This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past.</notes>
            <description>From the ruins of the ancient world, women and men created a new civilization: Europe. Combining history, archaeology and science, this course examines the extraordinary transformations of belief systems, warfare, technology, law and government, business practices, food production, disease and climate in the Middle Ages, between the fall of Rome and the Italian Renaissance. Themes include the spread of Christianity, the challenge of Islam, the Vikings, Crusades, feudalism, Europe&amp;rsquo;s economic rise and the Black Death.</description>
