            <prereq>Course open to Freshman Students Only</prereq>
            <description>This seminar aims to help students, including those who are genuine novices in acting, to understand and experience theater as a form of physical expression that evolve as aesthetic and social contexts change across time. Readings include the most famous French playwrights of both the early modern age (Moli&amp;egrave;re, Corneille, Racine) and the later twentieth / early twenty-first centuries. Special emphasis is paid the transformative power of performance and the development of the students&amp;rsquo; acting skills through practical workshops and videos of recent productions. The final project consists of an excerpt to be performed in French or bilingual format.</description>
