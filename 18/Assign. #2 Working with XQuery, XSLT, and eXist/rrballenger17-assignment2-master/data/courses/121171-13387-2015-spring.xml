            <description>Asks students to think and write critically about American higher education--its history, purpose and ongoing challenges. Considers "the uses of the university" from a variety of perspectives: historical, sociological, economic, and developmental. Addresses questions: What constitutes a liberal arts education? What are its goals? How should students be assessed? What role do extracurricular activities play in a college education? Does a bachelor's degree certify a vocational education, a cultural one, or a moral one?</description>
