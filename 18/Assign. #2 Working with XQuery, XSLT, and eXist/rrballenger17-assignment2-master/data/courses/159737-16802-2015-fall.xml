            <description>What is happiness?&amp;nbsp; To what extent is our own happiness under our control, and what are the causes and consequences of happiness?&amp;nbsp; Is happiness important for living a good and successful life?&amp;nbsp; How does the pursuit of personal happiness interact with our obligations to others?&amp;nbsp; In this seminar we will work toward answering these and other questions by analyzing recent work from both philosophy and psychology.&amp;nbsp; Our goal is to construct a unified picture of happiness that incorporates what is best from both disciplines but appropriately takes into account various challenges that each has posed for the other.</description>
