            <description>This seminar is primarily for graduate students preparing for research and teaching in Japanese religions.&amp;nbsp; Because it will have a different focus each time it is offered, students may take it more than once.&amp;nbsp; The topic for Fall 2015 will be ethnographic studies of Shinto.&amp;nbsp; Future offerings of the course will focus on such topics as shrine festivals (matsuri), religion in the Japanese empire, and Japanese new religious movements.&amp;nbsp; Most readings will be in English, but Japanese-language readings will also be included.</description>
