            <title short_title="SOCIOL 161">Big Data: What is it?</title>
            <description>A tremendous amount of data is now being collected through websites, mobile phone applications, credit cards, and many more everyday tools we use extensively. What is currently done and what can we do with this precious resource? This big data course looks under the hood. It explores the logic behind the complex methods used in the field (not the methods itself). We then explore how big data research is designed with real life examples of cutting-edge research and guest lecturers from Facebook, Twitter and Google. By the end of the class students will be competent in the field and be able to conduct a research design using big data.</description>
