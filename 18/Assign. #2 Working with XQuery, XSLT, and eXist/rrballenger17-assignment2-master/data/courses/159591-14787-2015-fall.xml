            <description>This course will focus on the legal aspects of the American phase of the Vietnam War. What was the legal basis for the intervention? What sorts of compliance with the law of war occurred? Was the American people concerned about the dubious legality of revelations like the My Lai massacre and the &amp;ldquo;secret&amp;rdquo; Cambodian bombings? What legal steps were taken in the aftermath? The course will consist of a series of readings to show how little historians have investigated these questions, and a series of assignments culminating in a serious research paper based on original sources.</description>
