            <description>This course introduces students to several fundamental notions and methods in statistical physics that have been successfully applied to the analysis of information processing systems. Discussions will be focused on studying such systems in the infinite-size limit, on analyzing the emergence of phase transitions, and on understanding the behaviors of efficient algorithms. This course seeks to start from basics, assuming just undergraduate probability and analysis, and in particular assuming no knowledge of statistical physics. Students will take an active role by applying what they learn from the course to their preferred applications.</description>
