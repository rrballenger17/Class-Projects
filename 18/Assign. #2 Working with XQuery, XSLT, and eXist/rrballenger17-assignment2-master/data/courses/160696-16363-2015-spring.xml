            <description>Have you ever abandoned a New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolution? Do you find yourself flipping through Facebook as a final exam nears? These common experiences can be explained by self-regulation, an exciting yet elusive construct that has captured the attention of researchers across psychology. In this course, students will explore the widespread influence of self-regulation through diverse scholarly sources accompanied by spirited discussion. Spanning several subdisciplines of psychology to address its hottest topics from the theoretical and empirical lens of self-regulation, we will divide the course by its many domains of practical relevance (e.g., behavior, emotion, learning) and apply them to students&amp;rsquo; own lives.</description>
