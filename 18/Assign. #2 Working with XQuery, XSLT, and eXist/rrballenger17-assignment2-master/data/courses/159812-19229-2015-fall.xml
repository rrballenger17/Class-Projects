            <title short_title="CLS-STDY 141">Storytelling and Deceptive Narration at Rome and Beyond</title>
            <description>How do we make others believe us when we stretch the truth? This course is both a survey of ancient Roman literature and an introduction to the classic tools of storytelling and deception that we still encounter today. We will study how ancient authors manipulate our perception of the stories they tell and see how these techniques recur in modern examples. Topics include historical legend, love poetry, the courtroom strategy of Cicero, political propaganda in epic poetry, Aesopic fables, ghost stories, and the account of a man transformed into a donkey. We end with several modern short stories. Readings are in English.</description>
