            <title short_title="HIST 1914">The History of Environmental Activism</title>
            <exam_group>FAS14_H</exam_group>
            <description>Why do some human beings step forward to defend the non-human? It has been unusual, in human history, to express concern for the non-human parts of nature; to do something politically relevant with that concern is rarer still.&amp;nbsp; In this class, we will examine the history of why and how people have done both.&amp;nbsp; We will trace the origins of environmental ideas, broadly defined, and then the historical processes by which activism on behalf of the environment has become part of national and global cultures.&amp;nbsp; As well, we will analyze different media and modes for expressing environmentalist action, as they have developed over time.&amp;nbsp; And we will interrogate the character and role of the activist.</description>
