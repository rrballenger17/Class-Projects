            <description>MCB 142 aims to develop an understanding of some of the principal advances leading to our present understanding of evolution and heredity, from Mendel and Darwin to the discovery of the genetic code. Course work includes critical reading of original papers, student presentations, group discussion, and submission of written answers to problem sets. Participation in class discussion of readings is essential. A substantial essay on a mutually agreed topic is due at end of reading period.</description>
