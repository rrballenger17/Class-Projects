            <exam_group>FAS02_C</exam_group>
            <description>The rapid rise of China on the global stage is one of the most stunning developments of our time. Since the early 1980's, when China reopened its doors to research by foreign scholars, growing numbers of anthropologists have been conducting fieldwork in the People's Republic. What have anthropologists learned about the transformations underway there? What new constructs and field strategies does the anthropology of China have to contribute to anthropology generally? In this course we seek answers in film and ethnography. Following existing emphases in the literature, we will focus on issues of transformation in governance, subjectivity, and difference in a nation under an increasingly neoliberal regime.</description>
