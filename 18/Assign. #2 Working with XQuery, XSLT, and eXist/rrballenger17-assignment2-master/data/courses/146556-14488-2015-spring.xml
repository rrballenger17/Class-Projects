            <description>Written at the midpoint of Shakespeare's career (1600-01), Hamlet marks the culmination of an experiment in representing the inner life with remarkable human sympathy. Hamlet also marks the beginning, in the comedies as much as in the famous tragedies, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, of a new and disturbing interest in the human mysteries of sadism, power, eroticism and loss.</description>
