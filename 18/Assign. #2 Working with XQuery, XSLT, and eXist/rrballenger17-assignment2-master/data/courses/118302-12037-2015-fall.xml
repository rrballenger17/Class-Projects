            <prereq>Recommended: Mathematics 23a,b or 25a,b or 55a,b; or Mathematics 21a,b plus at least one other more advanced course in mathematics; or an equivalent background in mathematics.</prereq>
            <description>Develops the theory of convex sets, normed infinite-dimensional vector spaces, and convex functionals and applies it as a unifying principle to a variety of optimization problems such as resource allocation, production planning, and optimal control. Topics include Hilbert space, dual spaces, the Hahn-Banach theorem, the Riesz representation theorem, calculus of variations, and Fenchel duality. Students will be expected to understand and invent proofs of theorems in real and functional analysis.</description>
