            <description>This is a comprehensive course in Neuroscience. Basic principles of organization and function of the nervous system will be discussed with frequent reference to pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Combining pathophysiology with basic neuroscience should provide physician/scientists and Ph.D. candidates with a dynamic picture of the rapidly evolving field of neuroscience and the experimental process from which the picture is derived, and all students should emerge with a greater awareness both of the applications of their work in alleviating disease, and of the ways that disease can provide insight into basic scientific questions. The course will span modern neuroscience from molecular neurobiology to perception and cognition, and will include the following major topics: Anatomy and Development of the Brain; Cell Biology of Neurons and Glia; Ion Channels and Electrical Signaling; Synaptic Transmission, Integration, and Chemical Systems of the Brain; Sensory Systems, from Transduction to Perception; Motor Systems; and Higher Brain Function (Memory, Language, Affective Disorders).</description>
