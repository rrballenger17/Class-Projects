            <exam_group>FAS13_G</exam_group>
            <description>&amp;nbsp;This course will examine both Michelangelo&amp;rsquo;s extensive artistic production&amp;mdash;in painting, drawing sculpture, architecture, and poetry&amp;mdash;as well as the image of him created by contemporary and subsequent biographies, critiques, and theoretical texts.&amp;nbsp; Exalted as the pinnacle of creative genius within his own lifetime, we will consider how the multi-faceted exemplar of Michelangelo shaped the visual culture of his age and continued to have a lasting impact on generations of artists that followed.&amp;nbsp;</description>
