            <description>Four principal animal groups (insects, frogs, birds and mammals) sing and call in habitats around the world. We discuss the ecology, evolution and characteristics of such acoustic communities and the hypothesis that their members compete for "bandwidth". We discuss readings on acoustic ecology and evolution, and listen to (and watch, via spectrum analysis) soundscapes from selected tropical and temperate habitats. The capstone will be a fieldtrip to record natural soundscapes.</description>
