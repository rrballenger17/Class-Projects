            <description>Science, in its many guises, is a crucial force in the modern world. How has its growing authority reshaped American democracy since the late nineteenth century? Our readings will address that question in theoretical and practical terms by exploring science's changing roles in academia, political ideology, social thought, popular culture, public education, state administration, and law, as well as its complex ties to religion, secularism, and technological innovation.</description>
