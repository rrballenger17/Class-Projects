            <title short_title="ENGLISH CDPR">Devotional Poetry</title>
            <description>In this workshop we will focus on the devotional poetry of John Donne, George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, and GM Hopkins, looking first into certain texts of the Old Testament&amp;mdash;Psalms, Song of Solomon, Book of Job&amp;mdash;from which so much of devotional poetry extends. In conversation with these four poets, students can expect to build and execute their own plaintive lyric &amp;ldquo;I,&amp;rdquo; design new ecstatic/meditative soundscape, and plan and deliver the imagistic configurations that will best give them direct-line access to the God (or gods) of their own choice or invention.&amp;nbsp;As this a poetry workshop, all assignments will be creative.</description>
