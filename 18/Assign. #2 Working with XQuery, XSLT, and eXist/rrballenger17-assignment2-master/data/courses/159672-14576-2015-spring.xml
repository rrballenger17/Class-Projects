            <title short_title="ENGLISH 61A">The Literature of Empire</title>
            <description>This course investigates how writers in the English-speaking world represented race, nation, and empire at a time when these categories were being renegotiated. We will read a wide range of authors from Britain, the US, the Caribbean, India, and Sub-Saharan Africa, including Kipling, Forster, Twain, Du Bois, Plaatje, Kincaid, and Ishiguro. We will ask: how do national and imperial imaginaries differ? How did minority writers manipulate narratives of empire to gain recognition as citizens?</description>
