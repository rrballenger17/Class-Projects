            <title short_title="PHIL 158X">Self-Consciousness and Self Knowledge: Proseminar</title>
            <description>Many of the most interesting and puzzling features of the mind are connected with the fact that each of us seems to have a special perspective on his or her own mind, a perspective that gives us a distinctive awareness of ourselves &amp;ldquo;as subject, not mere object&amp;rdquo; and a distinctive knowledge of our own mental lives &amp;ldquo;from the first person perspective&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp; We will consider the nature of such self-consciousness and self-knowledge, and also some striking ways in which we can be unknown to ourselves.</description>
