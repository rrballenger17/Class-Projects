            <description>Mind reading is not the stuff of science fiction, is it a complex set of mental processes honed throughout our evolutionary history that allow us to survive and thrive in a social world. But what is a mind? Who has one? Can we ever know what is in the minds of others? In this course we will attempt to answer these questions by exploring how the human mind uses perceptual information to infer other peoples&amp;rsquo; thoughts, beliefs, and desires. Our goal will be to critically examine why people succeed and fail at reading others&amp;rsquo; minds</description>
