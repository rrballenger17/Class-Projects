            <description>This survey course will trace the history of both Unitarianism and Universalism from their eighteenth-century origins to the present. Focusing especially on the experiences of local congregations, we will explore the diverse starting points of liberal religion in the United States; the challenges of Transcendentalism, spiritualism, and humanism; the interplay between liberal religion and social reform; and the experience of consolidation in the twentieth century.</description>
