            <description>This course will focus on medically important eukaryotic parasites (including malaria, toxoplasma, leishmania, trypanosomes, amoebae, and giardia). We will examine central themes in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Critical readings and discussions will emphasize biochemistry, cell and molecular biology of host-pathogen interactions during the establishment and maintenance of infection in hosts and host cells. To the extent to which it is possible, infection strategies of protozoan parasites will be compared and contrasted to those of bacterial and viral pathogens in hosts and host cells.</description>
