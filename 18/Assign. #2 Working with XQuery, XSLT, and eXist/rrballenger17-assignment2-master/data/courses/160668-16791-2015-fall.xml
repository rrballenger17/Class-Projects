            <notes> The course will feature film screenings (LoÃ¯e Fuller and Pina Bausch; animation by Oskar Fischinger), guest lectures and visits to Harvard Library collections. Weâll be reading poetic texts in translation, with an eye to comparing them with the original.</notes>
            <description>This course explores the interchange between dance and poetry in late nineteenth and early twentieth-century culture across a variety of literary traditions: Anglo-American (Pound, Yeats, Eliot); French (Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Mallarm&amp;eacute;); German and Austrian (Trakl, Rilke); Italian (Campana, Marinetti, Soffici); and Spanish (Lorca). How can poetry draw inspiration from dance and use it as a model for formal experimentation? Through a hands-on engagement with a number of seminal texts, students will learn how dance can set words in motion&amp;mdash;and how, conversely, words can deal with the challenge of representing subtle nuances of bodily expression. We&amp;#39;ll focus on issues such as musicality and rhythm, free verse, meter and lyricism in poetry; broader attention will be given to inter-artistic borrowings, including synaesthesia (the blending of sensory modalities), ekphrasis (the literary imitation of a visual object), and Gesamtkunstwerk (the drive to achieve a total work of art).</description>
