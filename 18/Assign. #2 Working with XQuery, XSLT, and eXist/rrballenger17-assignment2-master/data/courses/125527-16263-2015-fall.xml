            <description>Family forms in the United States have varied widely over the centuries. This course will consider the radical innovations of 17th century Puritans, eighteenth-century Moravians, and nineteenth-century Mormons; the role of the family in debates over slavery, immigration, and the status of American Indians; and the impact of legal, economic, and social changes on mainstream ideals and practices. Students will work with a wide variety of family records as well as public documents and will have the option of writing about their own family history.</description>
