            <title short_title="RELIGION 44">Augustine's Confessions</title>
            <description>The aim of this course is to introduce students to the Confessions of Augustine of Hippo, a Christian theologian of the 4th/5th c. This seminar will introduce students to the life of Augustine, but will focus on a close reading of the Confessions in English translation, attending to such questions as: what is a &amp;quot;confession&amp;quot; and how does it relate to autobiography?&amp;nbsp; Who is the &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; that speaks and the &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; to whom it speaks, and what is the condition of that speech? How are we best to understand this text, as a work of theology, philosophy, or literature (or is that division even helpful)?</description>
