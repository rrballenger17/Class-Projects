            <description>Why were ancient Greek athletic competitions conducted as religious tradition and ritual observance? What was the relationship of the idealized Greek athlete to the Olympian world of the gods, and the chthonic, local world of the heroes? How were athletics related to political power and cultural memory? Exploring the four classical sanctuaries that were the sites of Panhellenic games (Olympic, Pythian [Delphi], Nemean, and Isthmian [Corinth]), as well as the Panathenaic Games in Athens, this course considers both archeological and literary evidence.</description>
