            <title short_title="ANTHRO 1600">Grounding the Global: Anthropological Approaches</title>
            <description>What is the value of anthropology for understanding today&amp;rsquo;s world? This course illustrates the importance of an anthropological perspective for engaging with a wide range of pressing global issues such as bilingualism, water and the environment, visual media, and health epidemics. Over the semester, students will grapple with what it means to &amp;quot;ground the global&amp;quot; through an emphasis on everyday experience, cultural particularity, subject formation, and collective action.&amp;nbsp;</description>
