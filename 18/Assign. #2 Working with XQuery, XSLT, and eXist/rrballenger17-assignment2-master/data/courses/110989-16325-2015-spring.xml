            <description>Matrices provide the algebraic structure for solving myriad problems across the sciences. We study matrices and related topics such as linear transformations and linear spaces, determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Applications include dynamical systems, ordinary and partial differential equations, and an introduction to Fourier series.&amp;nbsp;</description>
