            <description>This is a course in linguistic anthropology. We explore key theoretical issues in the semiotic anthropology of language use, focusing on communication, social (inter)action, representation, cultural conceptualization, and language ideology. By presenting many of the most influential and innovative contributions to the study of language in culture and society_both recent and classic_the course aims to guide students in asking fundamental questions about language and communication more broadly as facts of everyday sociocultural experience.</description>
