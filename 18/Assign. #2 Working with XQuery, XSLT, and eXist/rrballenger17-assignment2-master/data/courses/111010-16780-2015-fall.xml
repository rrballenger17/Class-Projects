            <description>Speaking the language of modern mathematics requires fluency with the topics of this course: infinite series, integration, and differential equations. Model practical situations using integrals and differential equations. Learn how to represent interesting functions using series and find qualitative, numerical, and analytic ways of studying differential equations. Develop both conceptual understanding and the ability to apply it.</description>
