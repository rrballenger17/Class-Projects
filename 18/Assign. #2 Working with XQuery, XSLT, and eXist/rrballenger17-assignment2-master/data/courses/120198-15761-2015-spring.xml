            <description>Many complex physical problems defy simple analytical solutions or even accurate analytical approximations. Scientific computing can address certain of these problems successfully, providing unique insight. This course introduces some of the widely used techniques in scientific computing through examples chosen from physics, chemistry, and biology. The purpose of the course is to introduce methods that are useful in applications and research and to give the students hands-on experience with these methods.</description>
