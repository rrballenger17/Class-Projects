            <prereq>Course open to Freshman Students Only</prereq>
            <description>This course examines dreams with an emphasis on their relation to the creative process and problem solving. It draws on psychology predominantly-neurophysiology, clinical, and personality research while also including perspectives from history, religion, art, literature, and anthropology. We'll visit a sleep laboratory and a dream-artist's studio. Students will keep a dream journal, and engage in exercises to improve dream recall, influence content toward lucidity and other goals, and to interpret your dreams. Students will write a term paper on a dream-related topic of their choice.</description>
