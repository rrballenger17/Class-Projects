            <description>In any long-form nonfiction (essay, memoir, travelogue, journalism), there are countless ways of structuring and telling a true story. In this workshop, students examine various techniques for giving nonfiction material dramatic and suspenseful energy: chronology, argument, juxtaposition, retrospection, evolving revelation. In addition to workshopping student writing, we discuss examples of the genre by writers such as Julia Blackburn, Truman Capote, Spalding Gray, and Janet Malcolm. Assignments include two 10-15 page narratives, an extensive revision, and typed critiques of classmates' work.</description>
