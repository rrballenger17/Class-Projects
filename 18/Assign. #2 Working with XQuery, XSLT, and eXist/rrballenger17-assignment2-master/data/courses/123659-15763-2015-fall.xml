            <description>Investigates human brain function through famous neurological cases and what we have learned from them: Broca's patient "Tan" whose case led to the identification of one of the brain's language areas; Phineas Gage, whose injury to a specific brain region changed his personality dramatically; and patient HM who, after brain surgery, no longer could remember things for more than a few minutes. Readings will be from my book Creating Mind.</description>
