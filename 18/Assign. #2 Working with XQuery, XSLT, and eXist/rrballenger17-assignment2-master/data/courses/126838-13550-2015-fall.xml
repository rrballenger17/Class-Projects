            <description>Provides an introduction to acting by combining elements of a discussion seminar with exercises, improvisations and performance activities. Uses improvisation to improve group/ensemble dynamics, minimize habitual behaviors and to develop characters. Explores a range of acting techniques designed to give students greater access to their creativity, imagination and emotional life. In the later part of the term we will work on monologues. Students also attend and critique productions at the Loeb Drama Center and other theaters in the Boston area.</description>
