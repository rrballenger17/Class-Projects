            <notes>Once upon a time, there was no Harry Potter. Once upon a time, there was no such thing as children&amp;rsquo;s literature. When and if children learned to read, they read what grown-ups read. How then did writing for children as we now know it come of age? Why does the genre have such an enduring hold on our cultural imagination, even as it continues to provoke sharp debate over its greater purpose and value? Are classic children&amp;rsquo;s books like The Wizard of Oz, The Wind in the Willows, and The Cat in the Hat instructive or subversive, didactic or liberating? In this course we&amp;rsquo;ll examine selections from three centuries of popular prose and verse written expressly for and about children as we investigate how this eclectic canon reflects evolving ideas about childhood, changing views about educating and enchanting young readers, and persistent disputes over what and how children should learn from books. In Unit 1 we&amp;rsquo;ll survey landmark works in English for children from the Puritan through the Victorian eras, including the New England Primer, Grimms&amp;rsquo; Tales, and Alice in Wonderland, as we consider what these texts tell us about the origin and evolution of the genre. In Unit 2 we&amp;rsquo;ll examine works by touchstone authors for younger readers including Mark Twain, Louisa May Alcott, Rudyard Kipling, E. B. White, C. S. Lewis, Maurice Sendak, and others, drawing on the critical perspectives of thinkers such as John Locke, Bruno Bettelheim, Alison Lurie, and Marina Warner to assess arguments about the essential function of imaginative literature from infancy through adolescence. In the final unit, students will conduct their own research to place a major children&amp;rsquo;s author of their choice in a relevant cultural and historical context.  Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.</notes>
