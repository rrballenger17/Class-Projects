            <title short_title="MCB 68">Cell Biology Through the Microscope</title>
            <prereq>Prerequisite: LS 1a OR LPS A</prereq>
            <description>MCB 68 explores three fundamental fields of eukaryotic cell biology: chromosome segregation, cell motility, and neuroscience. Each topic is approached from a historic and technical perspective. Students will discover these systems as the scientific field did, learning how each successive advance in microscopy revealed new biological details. Students will come away with a theoretical and hands-on understanding of microscopy as well as a grasp of the biological findings each technology revealed.</description>
