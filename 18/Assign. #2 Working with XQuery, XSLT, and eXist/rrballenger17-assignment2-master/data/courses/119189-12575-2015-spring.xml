            <prereq>Recommended: Science of Living Systems 20 and Psychology 18.</prereq>
            <description>Why do some individuals intentionally engage in behaviors that cause themselves direct bodily harm, such as suicide and self-mutilation? We explore past and current models for understanding self-harm behaviors. We consider the classification, etiology, assessment, and treatment of self-harm behaviors from psychological, developmental, contextual, and biological perspectives.</description>
