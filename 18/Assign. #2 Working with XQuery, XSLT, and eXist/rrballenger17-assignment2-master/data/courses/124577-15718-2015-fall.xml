            <description>Critically examines recent philosophical work on questions of racial justice: What is racism? What makes racial discrimination wrong? Are reparations owed for past racial injustices? Is racial profiling ever justified? Under what conditions should we regard racial disparities (e.g., in wealth or employment) as unjust? Should government foster racial integration in schools and neighborhoods? Is affirmative action unfair? Is a just society a "color-blind" society?</description>
