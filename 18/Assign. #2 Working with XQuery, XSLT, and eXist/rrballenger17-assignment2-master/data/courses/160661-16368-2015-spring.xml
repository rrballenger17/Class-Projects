            <description>Radcliffe Choral Society (SSAA choir). The Radcliffe Choral Society is dedicated to the celebration and performance of women&amp;rsquo;s choral music. Founded in 1899, RCS is Harvard&amp;#39;s oldest women&amp;#39;s organization and one of the country&amp;rsquo;s premier women&amp;#39;s choruses. The Choral Society sings a wide variety of repertoire including Medieval chant, Renaissance polyphony, Romantic masterworks, international folk songs, and contemporary women&amp;rsquo;s choral music. RCS tours annually. The Choral Society frequently combines with the Collegium and the Glee Club, as well as the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, to perform large-scale works. Students must complete both parts of this course (parts A and B) within the same academic year in order to receive credit.</description>
