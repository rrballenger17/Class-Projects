            <description>Students gain research skills along with an understanding of the production of sociological knowledge through work on faculty research projects.&amp;nbsp; Work is arranged and directed by faculty members, who supervise and meet with students regularly (every 1-2 weeks).&amp;nbsp; The specifics of the intellectual goals for the student and the research tasks involved will vary.&amp;nbsp; The student and faculty member will consult on this in advance and will outline the following on the 92r Registration Form: &amp;nbsp;1) the specific skills to be learned, 2) how the course will engage students with the discipline, and 3) the specific work product.&amp;nbsp; What students produce will depend on the kind of research involved.&amp;nbsp; It is expected that students will work 8 to 10 hours per week on the course.&amp;nbsp; Students may engage with data collection, data analysis, literature reviews, or other aspects of a faculty project.</description>
