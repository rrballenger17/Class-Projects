            <description>New Music Analysis. In this course we will engage a variety of music from ca. 1970 to the present. "New" in the course's title applies also to "Analysis". We will work toward developing new ways of hearing, conceptualizing, and talking/writing about music that might respond to the challenges that the new or "now" affords. Our repertory will comprise many pieces (not all "high" and "western"); a small selection will be subject to intense hearing and discussion.</description>
