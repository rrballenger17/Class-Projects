<p>You will be working with a set of files containing <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>-formatted 
records of the
form (URL, timestamp, set of tags). One record represents the fact
that someone visited the URL at the given time, and labelled the visit
with a number of tags. Here is some sample data:

<pre>
    {"url": "http://freegasmoney.org/", "timestamp": 1257034785, "tags": ["free", "gas", "coupon"]}
    {"url": "http://www.autodriver.com/car-loans/pre-approved-auto-loans/index.html", "timestamp": 1257119583, "tags": ["approved", "car", "loans", "auto", "loan", "approval", "pre"]}
    {"url": "http://www.simplykidstoys.com/precious-princess-perfect-dollhouse.html", "timestamp": 1257107683, "tags": ["toys", "birthday", "christmas", "dollhouse"]}
    {"url": "http://thenuweigh.com/", "timestamp": 1257042871, "tags": ["diet", "diets", "fatloss", "weight", "loss", "program"]}
</pre>

<p>The timestamps represent the number of seconds since January 1,
1970. This is a very common way of representing time in software.

<p>This data is from a
<a href="http://cnets.indiana.edu/groups/nan/givealink">research
project</a>. It is organized into 15 files, for a total of
11MB. 
<h2>Download the data</h2>
Download the data from <a href="links.tgz">here</a>. You can unpack
the data using the command <tt><b>tar xvzf links.tgz</b></tt>.
The data will be unpacked in a subdirectory <font face="courier new"><b>files.1</b></font>.
<p>
The data originates 
<a href="http://carl.cs.indiana.edu/data/websci2014/givealink-nov-2009.tgz">here</a>,
but it needed some cleaned-up, and reorganization into two directories. Do NOT use this original
data.
<h2>Problems to solve</h2>
<b>Problem 1.</b> Write a <font face="courier new"><b>Map/Reduce</b></font> 
solution that lists the url's with the (comma-separated)
union of the tags listed in all the
records for each url. For example, suppose the following two records were seen in the stream:
<pre>
    {"url": "http://freegasmoney.org/", "timestamp": 1257034785, "tags": ["free", "gas"]}
    {"url": "http://freegasmoney.org/", "timestamp": 1257034877, "tags": ["free", "gas", "vacation"]} </pre>
The final output from your solution would have one line:
<pre><b>     http://freegasmoney.org/ free,gas,vacation</b></font></b></pre>
Note: the tags are comma-separated, no white space, and the key/value pair is separated by a single white space. 
Run your solution on the local file system, i.e. not against the Hadoop cluster. 
Capture the first ten lines of the final output and submit it with your solution. For
correctness you can compare your results with this reference result: <a href="prob1-first-ten.txt">
prob1-first-ten</a>
<p><i>Hint:</i> You will need to have your <font face="courier new"><b>Reducer</b></font> collect the tags in a 
<font face="courier new"><b>java.util.Set</b></font>, which it can 
use in <font face="courier new"><b>cleanup</b></font> to write the result.
<p>
To parse the lines of data use this Java code <a href="Link.zip">Link.zip</a> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="courier new"><b>Link.java</b></font> has a
static method <font face="courier new"><b>parse</b></font> that takes a 
<font face="courier new"><b>String</b></font>. In <font face="courier new"><b>Mapper.map</b></font> 
you can run <font face="courier new"><b>Link.parse</b></font> on each incoming line.
This will produce a <font face="courier new"><b>Link</b></font> object. Note that 
<font face="courier new"><b>Link.parser</b></font> returns
<font face="courier new"><b>null</b></font> when it encounters bogus data. [Suggestion: extract
a small set of records, say 5 lines, into a single file to run your code on while developing 
your solution. Two gotchas: (1)blank lines in a data file, (2) editor backup files, like emacs' ~ recovery
files. Either of these will cause problems.]
<p>
<b>Problem 2. </b> Write a <font face="courier new"><b>Map/Reduce</b></font> 
solution that lists the url's of every record between two dates. Your solution must
accomodate command line arguments for the dates in addition to the input/output directories.
The date format to support is <font face="courier new"><b>dd-MM-yyyy</b></font>. The data reflect
records between Novermber 1, 2009, and November 15, 2009. The final output should list each URL
and the count of its appearances.
<p>You will need two strategies: one to convert the dates on the command lines to 
<font face="courier new"><b>long</b></font> values to be used as filters
in the <font face="courier new"><b>map</b></font> method, and one to put these values
into play from the driver's <font face="courier new"><b>main</b></font>. Here are three
lines of code for the first of these: <pre><b>    SimpleDateFormat simpleDateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("dd-MM-yyyy");
    simpleDateFormat.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("EST"));
    Date startDate = simpleDateFormat.parse(args[2]);
    Long startmilliseconds = startDate.getTime()/1000;</b></pre>
The division by 1000 is to reduce the value from milliseconds to seconds.
<p>The second strategy, getting the values into play, is for you to discover, using this hint:
The <font face="courier new"><b>Configuration</b></font> used in creating the 
<font face="courier new"><b>Job</b></font> is a convenient place to hold named parameters 
for later use.
<p><b>Run your solution, giving start date as November 8, 2009 and end date as November 9, 2009. Submit
the resulting part-r-00000.</b> 
<h2>Submission requirements</h2> 
A zip file containing 
<ul>
<li>All the Java files for each problem.  [All classes should belong to package 
<font face="courier new"><b>cscie55.hw8</b></font>]
<li>The output files created by running
the MR code (locally) for each driver class containing <font face="courier new"><b>main</b></font>.
<ul>
<li>
 first 10 lines [<font face="courier new"><b>part-r-00000</b></font>] 
for problem 1, 
<li>the entire output file for problem 2. [Ref: <a href="time-link-part-2-00000">prob2-part-r-00000</a>]
</ul>
<li>A jar file containing all class files in a form suitable to run solutions
for all three problems.
<li>A solution overview, explaining each of the MR solutions.
</ul>
