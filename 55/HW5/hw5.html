<h1>Homework #5: Due Monday April 11th<!-- April 15th-->, Grade: 15%</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This homework continues HW4 by placing a BankServer between the
  Bank and its users. The BankServer handles simultaneous requests from 
  a set of users, and assigns each request to be executed by one thread.
  This sets the stage for building a distributed
  system in which the Bank users are on different machines from the
  Bank and BankServer. For now, everything still runs in a single Java
  process.

<p>As in HW4, some code will be provided and you will write some. Here
  is an overview:

</pre>

<p>A jar file containing all of the provided code can be found <a href="hw5provided-sources.jar">here</a>.

<p>The classes labeled "From HW4" should be copied into a new project and
 package (<tt>cscie55.hw5.bank</tt>) and modified as described below.

<p>You will be responsible for writing two
classes, <tt>BankServerImpl</tt> and
<tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt>. These classes form the basis of
a <i>server</i>.
<tt>BankServerImpl</tt>, which implements the
<tt>BankServer</tt> interface, accepts incoming commands, which are objects
of subtypes of <tt>Command</tt>. (The <tt>Command</tt> subtypes are
provided.) <tt>BankServerImpl</tt> manages a queue containing
commands. 

<p>Your server also includes a set
of <tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt>s. 
<tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt> extends <tt>Thread</tt> and so 
has a <tt>run()</tt> method. <tt>run()</tt>
pulls <tt>Command</tt>s from the queue and executes them, using
the <tt>Bank</tt> and <tt>Account</tt> classes that you will be
adapting from HW4.

<h2>Copy and modify your HW4 code</h2>

You will need to copy the <tt>BankImpl</tt> and <tt>AccountImpl</tt> code from HW4 into
your HW5 project, and modify it as follows:

<ul>
    <li>Change the package to <tt>cscie55.hw5.bank</tt>.
    <li><tt>BankImpl</tt> has three transfer methods, which tried
    different locking
    strategies. Keep <tt>transferLockingAccount</tt>,
      but rename it to <tt>transfer</tt>, and delete the other two.
      Also, add a <tt>deposit(int accountId, long amount)</tt> method
      to process deposits to the given account.
</ul>

<h2>Implement the BankServer interface</h2>

<pre>
    package cscie55.hw5.bank;
    
    import cscie55.hw5.bank.command.Command;
    
    public interface BankServer
    {
        /**
         * Executes the given Command.
         * @param command the Command to be executed.
         */
        void execute(Command command);
    
        /**
         * Stop the BankServer. No further Commands will be executed.
         * @throws InterruptedException
         */
        void stop() throws InterruptedException;
    
        /**
         * Returns the total of all Account balances for all Accounts managed by the BankServer's Bank.
         * @return The total of all Account balances for all Accounts  managed by the BankServer's Bank.
         */
        long totalBalances();
    }
</pre>

Copy <tt>BankServer</tt> into your project and then define a class
implementing it, named <tt>BankServerImpl</tt>. Your implementation
should do the following:

<ul>
    <li><b>Manage
    a <tt>Queue&lt;Command&gt;</tt></b>: <tt>Command</tt>s will reside
    in this queue after being submitted by the <tt>execute</tt>
    method, until they are removed from the queue and executed by
    a <tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt>.

    <li><b>Manage an array of <tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt>s.</b> These
    threads do the actual work of the server,
    pulling <tt>Command</tt>s off the queue and executing them.

    <li><b>Define a constructor</b> that creates and starts
    the <tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt>s.

    <li><b>Implement the <tt>execute</tt> method.</b> This simply adds 
      the given <tt>Command</tt> to the queue of commands.

    <li><b>Implement the <tt>stop</tt> method.</b> This should add a
    Stop command to the queue for each thread, and will cause
    each <tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt> to terminate. After doing
    this, call <tt>join()</tt> on each of these threads. Once all
    the <tt>join()</tt> calls complete, this method will return.

    <li><b>Implement the <tt>totalBalances()</tt> method</b>, by invoking 
    <tt>Bank.totalBalances()</tt>.
</ul>

<h2>Implement CommandExecutionThread</h2>

<p><tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt> extends <tt>Thread</tt>, and so
  must provide a <tt>run()</tt> method. This <tt>run()</tt> method
  will wait for the command queue to be non-empty. When this occurs,
  one <tt>Command</tt> is removed from the queue and executed. After
  execution, the thread needs to go back to waiting for its
  next <tt>Command</tt> to arrive. (An alternative is for
  the <tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt> to execute <i>all</i> commands
  in the command queue, but this will result in a very uneven
  distribution of commands to threads, which is undesirable. By
  executing only one command at a time, other threads can assist in
  removing and executing commands.)

<p>One special command is Stop. Execution of Stop
  does nothing. However, your <tt>run()</tt> method should return
  (terminating the thread) once it sees the Stop command. You can test
  whether a command is the Stop command by calling <tt>Command.isStop()</tt>.

<p><tt>run()</tt> should have a top-level loop that continues as long as 
<tt>Command.isStop()</tt> is false. Inside this loop is the wait loop
followed by command execution.

<p>You will need to write a constructor
  for <tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt> which should take three
  arguments:

<ul>
    <li><b><tt>Bank bank</tt></b>: The <tt>Bank</tt> on which the
    commands execute. You will need to pass this <tt>Bank</tt> object
    to the <tt>Command</tt>s being executed.

    <li><b><tt>Queue&lt;Command&gt; commandQueue</tt></b>: This is the 
    same command queue used by the <tt>BankServerImpl</tt>. <i>It is
    crucial for the <tt>BankServerImpl</tt> and
    the <tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt>s to synchronize on this
    command queue.</i> More on this below.

    <li><b><tt>boolean executeCommandInsideMonitor</tt></b>: Discussed
    below.
</ul>

<h2>Synchronization</h2>

<p>The <tt>BankServerImpl</tt> and all of
the <tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt>s share the
same <tt>Queue&lt;Command&gt;</tt> -- the <i>command queue</i>.
The <tt>BankServerImpl</tt>'s <tt>execute</tt> method adds
a <tt>Command</tt> to the command
queue. The <tt>CommandExecutionTherad</tt>s watch the command
queue. When a <tt>Command</tt> shows up in the queue, one of
the <tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt>s will eventually remove it from
the queue and execute it. In other words, there are multiple threads
accessing the command queue, one adding items to it, and all of the
others removing from it. Synchronization among these threads is needed
to guarantee correct operation by ensuring that no more than one
thread updates the queue at a time.

<p>Because it is the command queue that is shared among these threads,
  all of the classes involved must synchronize on this object,
  i.e. operate on the command queue only inside
  a <tt>synchronized</tt> block that "locks" the command queue. The
  code inside such a <tt>synchronized</tt> block is said to be inside
  a <i>monitor</i>.

<p>You should review the synchronization examples from class, (e.g. 
<a href="http://courses.dce.harvard.edu/~cscie55/CubbyHole.htm">CubbyHole</a>)
to see how this synchronization works. A key part of synchronization
involves signalling among threads. When the <tt>BankServerImpl</tt>
adds a <tt>Command</tt> to the command queue, it needs to signal all
of the <tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt>s that the queue is now not
empty, and that one of them needs to act. It does this by
calling <tt>notifyAll()</tt> on the command queue. This causes
the <tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt>s to exit <tt>wait()</tt>. One of them
will detect that the queue is non-empty and execute the first command in the queue, while
the others will go back to waiting.

<p>The <tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt> is a bit more
  complicated. Inside its <tt>synchronized</tt> block, it needs to
  sit in a loop waiting for the command queue to be non-empty. The
  waiting is implemented using the <tt>wait()</tt> method, applied to
  the command queue. When <tt>BankServerImpl</tt>
  calls <tt>notifyAll()</tt> on the command queue, the threads sitting
  inside <tt>wait()</tt> for the command queue wake up to check if the
  queue is non-empty.

<p>If a non-empty queue is detected, then a <tt>Command</tt> is
  removed from the queue and executed. Note that
  the <tt>synchronized</tt> block ensures that if the command queue
  was observed to be empty, it <i>stays</i> empty until
  a <tt>Command</tt> can be removed, (as long as the loop and the
  removal are both inside the <tt>synchronized</tt> block).

<p>There is one important choice to be made in coding the execution of
  a <tt>Command</tt> removed from the queue: Should execution of
  the <tt>Command</tt> be inside or outside the <tt>synchronized</tt>
  block? <tt>Command</tt> execution may
  involve significant delays in a distributed system. In fact, the
  supplied <tt>Command</tt>s include a 1 msec. pause to simulate this
  effect. If command execution is done inside the monitor, (i.e.,
  inside the <tt>synchronized</tt> block), then you are blocking other
  threads from making progress. Synchronization protects the command
  queue from simultaneous updates. Command execution does not touch
  the command queue. So is there any reason for command execution to
  be inside the <tt>synchronized</tt> block? What is the impact of 
  doing command execution there?

<p>You should code your <tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt> to execute the
  command in two different ways, inside and outside
  the <tt>synchronized</tt> block, under control of the 
  executeCommandInsideMonitor flag, passed to
  the <tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt> constructor, e.g.

<pre>
    Command command;
    synchronized (commandQueue) {
        ...
        command = commandQueue.remove();
        if (executeCommandInsideMonitor) {
            command.execute(bank);
        }
    }
    if (!executeCommandInsideMonitor) {
        command.execute(bank);
    }
</pre>

<p>The provided test code will try execution both ways, and measure
  the impact on performance.

<h2>Your submission</h2>

As in HW4, your submission should include the following:

<ul>
    <li><b>hw5.jar</b>: A jar file containing all of the class files
    in packages <tt>cscie55.hw5.bank</tt> and <tt>cscie55.hw5.bank.command</tt>.

    <li><b>hw5-sources.jar</b>: A jar file containing all of the java files
    in packages <tt>cscie55.hw5.bank</tt> and <tt>cscie55.hw5.bank.command</tt>.

    <li><b>hw5-output.txt</b>: A text file containing the result of
    program output. <b>A blank file is not acceptable!</b>
    you <b>must</b> include JUnit output (one dot for each test that
    succees, along with the JUnit intro text). Run from the command
    line if necessary. The output will also contain performance measurements.

    <li><b>hw5-discussion.txt</b>: A discussion of the
    performance measurements.
</ul>

<p>The JUnit test, cscie55.hw5.Tester contains three tests. 
The code is available in 
<a href="hw5provided-sources.jar">the provided jar file</a>
and by itself 
<a href="Tester.java">here</a>.


<p>1) <tt>testSetup</tt> creates and then shuts down a <tt>BankServer</tt>,
checking that the initial balances were deposited correctly.

<p>2) <tt>testCorrectness</tt>
runs 20 client threads, and 5 <tt>CommandExecutionThread</tt>s to
execute 10,000 transactions. The test verifies that synchronization
was done correctly.

<p>3) <tt>measurePerformanceOfCommandInsideAndOutsideMonitor</tt> runs
  the same test (20 client threads, 5 server threads, 10,000
  transactions), twice, once with command execution inside the
  monitor, once outside. Your submission should discuss the
  differences in performance observed between these two runs. Which
  way is faster? Why?

<p>As in HW4, you should
disable <tt>measurePerformanceOfCommandInsideAndOutsideMonitor</tt>
until <tt>testCorrectness</tt> is running successfully, to completion.

<p>Be sure to read the comment at the top of <tt>Tester</tt> to understand 
what it is doing, in particular, how the <tt>BankServer</tt> is started, and how 
<tt>Tester</tt> interacts with it.
