            <description>We rely on our sense of touch for essential tasks and behaviors, including feeding, object recognition&amp;nbsp;and grasping, avoiding physical harm, mating behaviors, and child rearing. This course covers the neural components and circuitry that underlie our sense of touch. From skin to the cortex, we will explore touch and its role in development, diseases, and most importantly, in our everyday life. Students must complete both terms of this course(parts A and B) within the same academic year in order to receive credit.</description>
