            <description>This course will focus on the biology of organ growth and regeneration from a developmental perspective. How is the size and symmetry of our organs set? How does a regenerating animal sense that something is missing and eventually stop the regenerative process when tissues reform? We will learn about conserved developmental pathways that are necessary for adult regeneration and discuss how the aberrant activation of these pathways can lead to overgrowth disorders such as cancer.</description>
