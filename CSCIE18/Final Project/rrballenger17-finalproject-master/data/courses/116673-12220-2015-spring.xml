            <description>This course examines contemporary narratives set in Paris. Students explore writers' and filmmakers' perceptions of Paris and analyze the different ways in which the Parisian experience is presented. By reading and viewing stories about Paris, students gain insights into methods of narration and integrate various techniques into their own writing and speaking. They also develop a sophisticated understanding of how the French language is evolving, especially in its spoken form.</description>
