            <description>The tutorial will explore various approaches to the study of culture, drawing on studies in history, philosophy, art, literature, sociology, and photography.&amp;nbsp; Among the questions we will address are: In what ways does rhetoric shape politics, and what role does it play in national narratives?&amp;nbsp; How is historical memory constructed, and what are the competing forces that shape it?&amp;nbsp; What is the significance of public apologies, and does solidarity create moral responsibilities for historical injustices?&amp;nbsp; How is cultural domination exerted, and how is it resisted?&amp;nbsp; Is the censorship of art sometimes justified?&amp;nbsp; Why does the contest to control images loom so large in contemporary politics?</description>
