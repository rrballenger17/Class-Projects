            <description>This course is intended to enhance the teaching skills of graduate students in the
Sociology Department. Through a combination of classroom discussions and teaching simulations, the seminar challenges students to discover and hone their teaching styles, to develop a personal philosophy about teaching and learning, to develop selfâconfidence leading and facilitating small and large group discussions, to learn about the teaching resources that are available to them throughout the university, to experiment with designing engaging courses of study, and to discover that teaching can be a rewarding and stimulating element of an academic career.</description>
