            <description>How do we understand development in Africa? This introductory course explores the question of sustainable development through a number of methods and perspectives, such as education, health, governance, (post-)conflict, and human rights. The course will examine the challenges of development, understood as the interaction between economic, environmental, political, and social processes. Students will gain the tools needed to examine African contexts today, including policy choices and the use of indicators and comparative analysis.</description>
