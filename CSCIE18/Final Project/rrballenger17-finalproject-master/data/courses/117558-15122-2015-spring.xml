            <title short_title="CHEM 27">Organic Chemistry of Life</title>
            <notes> Chemistry 27 and 30 may both be taken for degree credit. See note for Chemistry 17. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Science of Living Systems.</notes>
            <prereq>Recommended: Chemistry 17 or Chemistry 30 or Chemistry 20 with permission of the instructor.</prereq>
            <description>Chemical principles that govern the processes driving living systems are illustrated with examples drawn from biochemistry, cell biology, and medicine. The course deals with organic chemical reactivity (reaction mechanisms, structure-reactivity relationships), with matters specifically relevant to the life sciences (chemistry of enzymes, nucleic acids, drugs, natural products, cofactors), and with applications of chemical biology to medicine and biotechnology. An understanding of organic reactions and their "arrow" pushing mechanisms is required.</description>
