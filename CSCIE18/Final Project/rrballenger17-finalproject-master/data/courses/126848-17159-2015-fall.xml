            <description>By some accounts, the large expansion of the human brain evolved due to the complex demands of dealing with social others&amp;mdash;competing or cooperating with them, deceiving or empathizing with them, understanding or misjudging them. This discussion-based seminar surveys the emerging field of social cognitive neuroscience and its multi-level, multi-method approach to understanding the brain in its social context. We will review current theories and methods guiding the field and recent research examining the neural bases of social processes, including: theory of mind, empathy, morality, social decision-making, intergroup relations, among others.</description>
