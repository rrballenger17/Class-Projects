            <description>The aphorism &amp;ldquo;knowledge is power&amp;rdquo; evokes menacing images, such as state surveillance or corporate ownership of personal information, and hopeful images, such as curing disease or controlling personal destiny.&amp;nbsp; We hear contradictory messages that the internet and other new information tools are either freeing us or enslaving us. &amp;nbsp;What then is the relation between knowledge and power? This course will examine this question through close study of three historical cases, each rich with source material and analytic accounts.&amp;nbsp; In the final section of the course, students will select and analyze current issues that raise unresolved problems of knowledge and power.</description>
