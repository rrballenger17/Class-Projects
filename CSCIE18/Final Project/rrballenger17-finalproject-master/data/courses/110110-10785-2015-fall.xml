            <description>Does bullying lead to school shootings? Can Facebook cause depression? Are &amp;quot;fitspiration&amp;quot; communities dangerous? This course will review the role social factors (social support, social interactions, social functioning, and the broader social context of communities) relate to the development and maintenance of psychopathology on biological and behavioral levels. In the context of disorders such as schizophrenia, depression (including suicide), eating disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder, this course will look at how social factors might contribute to the development of mental illness, as well as how social factors might be indicators of mental illness, and finally how social factors might mediate the severity of or even prevent the development of mental illness.</description>
