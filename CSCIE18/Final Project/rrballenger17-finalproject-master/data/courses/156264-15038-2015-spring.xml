            <title short_title="AESTHINT 62">California in the 60's</title>
            <notes> This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding or Culture and Belief, but not both.</notes>
            <description>This course examines American youth culture in the "long" 1960s through the lens of music in California. Both "popular" and "art" music will be considered, including early minimalism, songs from L.A. and the Laurel Canyon crowd, and San Francisco psychedelia. In addition to understanding musical forms, performance styles, and the effects of technology (radio, recording, electric instruments), the class will delve into the politics of race, gender, resistance, and the draft.</description>
