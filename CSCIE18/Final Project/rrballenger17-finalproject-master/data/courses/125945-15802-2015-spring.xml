            <title short_title="CELTIC 188">Scottish Gaelic Poetry</title>
            <description>An exploration of the different types of vernacular Gaelic poetry composed in Scotland from the 16th to the 19th century, including personal lyrics and public praise-poetry, and an examination of the poets&amp;rsquo; responses to the transformation of Gaelic society from the &amp;rsquo;clan&amp;rsquo; period to the Jacobite Risings, the Highland Clearances and the Gaelic revival at the time of the Land Wars. The course is built around the close study of a series of key texts to be read in English translation.</description>
