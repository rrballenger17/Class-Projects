            <exam_group>FAS08_I</exam_group>
            <description>Bureaucracy is boring. And yet, its dreary routines and million petty frustrations have inspired some of the most interesting art and thought of the past two centuries. Where did bureaucracy come from, and why has it proved such a persistent object of fascination, particularly in the U.S.? How have bureaucratic institutions (government agencies, the modern corporation, etc.) shaped culture, and how have cultural objects shaped our ideas about bureaucracy? Readings from Melville, Weber, Orwell, Arendt, and Foucault; films include The Apartment, Die Hard, and Contagion.</description>
