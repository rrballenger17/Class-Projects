            <description>This course explores the &amp;lsquo;treasure house&amp;rsquo; of Gaelic folklore recorded in the Highlands of Scotland since the nineteenth century. The international controversy over Macpherson&amp;rsquo;s &amp;#39;Ossian&amp;#39; poems in the 1760s prompted interest in the Scottish Gaelic folklore from which they were adapted. Folklorists have since documented a wealth of orally recorded material, including tales of ancient heroes (e.g. Finn McCool) and beliefs in malevolent fairies, seal-people, dangerous water-horses, the evil eye and second sight. As we explore these fascinating topics, we will take into account international scholarly approaches to folklore.&amp;nbsp;</description>
