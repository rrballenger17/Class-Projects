            <notes>Required first meeting in spring: Monday, January 25, 8:30 am, Science Center C.  Spring section times: M.W.F. at 9 (with sufficient enrollment); M.W.F. at 10; M.W.F. at 11; M.W.F. at 12 (with sufficient enrollment).Tu.Th 10-11:30; Tu.Th. 11:30-1 (with sufficient enrollment).  Janet Chen, Jameel Al-Aidroos, Matthew Demers, Yu-Wen Hsu, and members of the Department.  This is a lecture taught in small sections.  May not be taken for credit by students who have passed Applied Mathematics 21a. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning. Activities using computers to calculate and visualize applications of these ideas will not require programming experience.</notes>

            <description>To see how calculus applies in practical situations described by more than one variable, we study: Vectors, lines, planes, parameterization of curves and surfaces, partial derivatives, directional derivatives and the gradient, optimization and critical point analysis, including constrained optimization and the Method of Lagrange Multipliers, integration over curves, surfaces and solid regions using Cartesian, polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates, divergence and curl of vector fields, and the Green&amp;#39;s, Stokes&amp;#39;s, and Divergence Theorems.</description>
