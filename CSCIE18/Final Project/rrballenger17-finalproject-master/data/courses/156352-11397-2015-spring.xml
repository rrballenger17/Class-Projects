            <description>This seminar addresses fundamental evolutionary concepts while exploring the dynamic relationship between plants and their pollinators. We will use plant-pollinator interactions to understand the science of mutualism, co-evolution, speciation, convergence, animal behavior, and conservation biology. Discussions and readings on these topics will be highlighted by trips to the Arnold Arboretum, the Harvard Museum of Natural History, the Wellesley College greenhouses, and a local beekeeper. We will utilize living plants to explore diversity in plant morphology and reproductive strategies.</description>
