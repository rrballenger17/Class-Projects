Students will also work on improving their communication skills, often in a simulated professional environment. Interactive oral and written activities are used to prepare students to work or travel for business in French-speaking countries. Those enrolled may take the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry exams and obtain an official diploma attesting to their proficiency in French.</description>
