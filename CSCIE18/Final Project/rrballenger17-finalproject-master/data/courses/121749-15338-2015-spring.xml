            <title short_title="LATIN 112B">History of Latin Literature II</title>
            <description>We will read extensive selections from major authors of the late Republic and Principate across a range of genres, from Vergil to Boethius, and satire to historiography, and consider their form and content against their historical contexts. Class will consist of a mixture of prepared translation from Latin and introductory lectures, while a weekly section will allow students to deepen their grammatical understanding of the texts. Designed for those with a good foundation of Latin grammar and vocabulary, students will be exposed to a robust amount of Latin prose and poetry, and at the end of the course will have acquired a solid grasp on Latin literary history.</description>
