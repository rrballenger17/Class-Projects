            <description>Human behavior is strikingly different from other animals: we speak languages, create tools, work together on large-scale endeavors, and even learn from others in university classrooms. What cognitive processes underlie these behaviors, and how did they emerge? In this course, we will examine the evolutionary origins of human cognition, with an eye to identifying what human psychological capacities are unique versus shared with other species.&amp;nbsp; To do so, we will integrate theoretical perspectives from biology concerning the evolution of intelligent behavior, with current empirical research from comparative psychology. Topics will include: social cognition, communication, inhibitory control, and memory and planning, with a focus on humans and other primates.</description>
