            <notes>Please install Mathematica and bring your laptop to every class. We will start programming on the very first day!  Grading based on final project, in-class assignments, in-class participation. No written exams, no written homework outside class. You will present your finished programs and pretty pictures to the class.</notes>
            <prereq>Recommended: Applied Mathematics 21a/b or Mathematics 21a/b. You know how to multiply matrices and vectors. No previous programming experience required.</prereq>
            <description>An inquiry based and hands on exploration in computational geometry. Topics include: projective geometry (duality between points/lines, symmetry among spheric/planar/hyperbolic geometry), linear algebra (vectors, matrices, symmetry groups) and recursion. We will draw pretty pictures (fractals, tesselations, algebraic curves, etc.). We will write computer programs in Mathematica (and possibly Java, if time permits).</description>
