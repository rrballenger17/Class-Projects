            <title short_title="SCIPHUNV 22">The Unity of Science: From the Big Bang to the Brontosaurus and Beyond</title>
            <notes> This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Science of the Physical Universe or Science of Living Systems, but not both.</notes>
            <description>Science is like well-woven, ever-expanding fabric, designed to (un)cover Nature's secrets. This course emphasizes the strong connections between subfields of science, showing it as the never-ending and greatest detective story ever told, with evidence always the arbiter. These characteristics are exhibited in the semi-historical treatment of three themes: unveiling the universe, the earth and its fossils, and the story of life.</description>
