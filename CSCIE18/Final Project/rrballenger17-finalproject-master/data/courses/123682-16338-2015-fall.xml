            <description>In this course a framework of tropospheric chemistry will be generated that requires no previous knowledge of this topic. The goal is to develop an understanding of chemical and physical processes in the troposphere. Focus is on the main processes transforming emissions into the secondary pollutants that affect the environment, human health, and climate, in particular with respect to the role of anthropogenic influence. This will provide a foundation for the evaluation of the impact the newest scientific studies have on our understanding of processes that are important for the part of the atmosphere we live in.</description>
