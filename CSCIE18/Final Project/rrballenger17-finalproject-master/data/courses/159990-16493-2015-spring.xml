            <description>The role of a person&amp;#39;s genetic background in determining whether he or she will develop cancer, and when, is the subject of constant debate and investigation.&amp;nbsp; This seminar will explore the biological and statistical bases of the connection between genetic background and cancer. In the process, students will become familiar with basic concepts of genetic inheritance in humans; with cancer evolutionary theories; with how to design population studies to investigate gene-disease associations; with the use of statistical methods to determine risk; and with the use of risk in complex decision making in health. There are no prerequisites.</description>
