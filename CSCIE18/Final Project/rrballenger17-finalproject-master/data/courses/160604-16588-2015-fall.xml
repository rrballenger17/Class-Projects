            <description>This course examines texts that foreground pressing concerns of the postcolonial world: in Africa, the Creole islands of the Caribbean and Indian Ocean, Europe and South Asia. Close attention will be paid to the relationship of a colonial culture to that of the metropolis, the functioning of minority and majority languages, and the narrative techniques that make these differences manifest in fictional and theoretical writing. The course includes discussion of postcolonial theory and its many debates.</description>
