            <description>Basic concepts, principles, and applications of environmental chemistry for students in Earth and environmental sciences. We will investigate a variety of chemistry topics relevant for environmental systems, including water chemistry, acids and bases, redox reactions, precipitation/dissolution, sorption, gas solubility, and aqueous and atmospheric reaction rates and mechanisms. The principal goal is to explore and apply the fundamental principles of chemical thermodynamics and kinetics to understand Earth processes and solve complex environmental problems.</description>
