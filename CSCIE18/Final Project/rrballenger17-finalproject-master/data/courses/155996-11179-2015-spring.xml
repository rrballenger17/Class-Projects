            <description>Whatever else it might be, European "modernity" is a transformation in Christian projects for ethics. Controversies over Reformation can conceal how far both Protestant and Roman Catholic writers begin to make modern assumptions about moral learning or to exercise modern forms of control over moral subjects. The course will try to trace some of this transformation and the increasingly radical reactions to it without pretending to any completion. Readings will include major texts from the Reformation through the 19th century.</description>
