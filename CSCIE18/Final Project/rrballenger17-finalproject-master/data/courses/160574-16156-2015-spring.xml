            <title short_title="HIST 1043">History of U.S. Imperialism, 1900-present</title>
            <notes> Instructor:  Holger Droessler</notes>
            <description>This lecture course explores the rise of the United States from a hemispheric to a global power over the course of the twentieth century. Two world wars, a global depression, the Cold War, and a series of smaller but no less violent conflicts dominated U.S. foreign relations during that time. The course concludes with an outlook on America&amp;rsquo;s role in a world marked by the rising influence of China and India as well as non-governmental actors. Throughout our discussions, we will pay special attention to the ways in which everyday people colluded and collided with U.S. imperialism.</description>
