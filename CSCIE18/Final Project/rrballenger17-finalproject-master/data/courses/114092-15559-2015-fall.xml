            <description>Foundation for understanding the relationship between biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, and medicine. Intensive treatment of human biochemistry and physiological chemistry that focuses on intermediary metabolism and structures of key intermediates and enzymes important in human disease. Principles of human genetics reviewed. Translation of clinical understanding into analysis at the level of the gene, chromosome, and molecule; the concepts and techniques of molecular biology and genomics; and the strategies and methods of genetic analysis. The clinical relevance of these areas is underscored with patient presentations.</description>
