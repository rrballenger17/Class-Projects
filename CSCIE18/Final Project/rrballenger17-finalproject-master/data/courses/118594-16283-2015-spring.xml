            <description>Seeks to develop a greater understanding of music, musical analysis, and critical listening. We will study some of the organizing principles of musical works (from a range of styles) by means of composition projects, score analysis, and aural skills. While reading knowledge of simple musical notation is helpful, there will be at least one section for students with no previous experience.</description>
