            <description>The word `Love' is almost never used in any portrayal or description of the African American community's daily life in contemporary media and in the social sciences. But in fact, Love, in all its many forms, familial, erotic, romantic, fraternal, is abundant, sometimes dominant, in Black culture: song, film, literature. This course will review and analyze the social science literature on intersubjectivity, family, language and ritual and closely read, watch and listen to some of the many Black artists who have looked deeply at this thing called Love.</description>
