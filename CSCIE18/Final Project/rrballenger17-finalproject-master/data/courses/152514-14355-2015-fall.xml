            <notes>This course ordinarily meets in Sanders Theatre on Mondays and Wednesdays from 1pm until 2pm, but students may simultaneously enroll in another course that meets at the same time. To do so, enroll in the other course via my.harvard.edu, and then email  enrollment@fas.harvard.edu  to have CS50 added to your study card as well. Undergraduates, GSAS students, and cross-registered students may take CS50 either Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (SAT/UNS) or for a letter grade. When taken for a letter grade, CS50 meets the General Education requirement for undergraduates for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning. See  cs50.harvard.edu  for FAQs.  </notes>

Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. 72% of CS50 students have never taken CS before.</description>
