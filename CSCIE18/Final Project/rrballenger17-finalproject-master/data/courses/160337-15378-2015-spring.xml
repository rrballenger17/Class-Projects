            <title short_title="SOC-STD 98PK">The Public and Its Problems: Democratic Theory in Practice</title>
            <notes> This course will be lotteried.</notes>
            <description>This course provides an in-depth introduction to contemporary democratic theory through both the lenses of its proponents (in their many forms) and its most trenchant critics.&amp;nbsp; The course will be organized historically, tracing forms and schools of democratic and anti-democratic theory through the 20th Century, with a constant eye towards historical precedents by focusing each week around particularly intransigent problems for democratic governance (e.g. labor disputes, penal organization).&amp;nbsp; Ultimately, the course aims to provide the student with both a detailed sense of the map of the contemporary terrain of democratic theory, and also a sense of why certain schools of proponents and critics coalesced around the public problems that they did.</description>
