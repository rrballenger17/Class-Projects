            <notes> This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding.</notes>
            <description>This course is both a survey of Asian American literature and an introduction to ongoing debates about what constitutes Asian American literature. How do we determine that a literary work is "Asian American" when the term has been continuously revised and expanded since it came into common usage in the late 1960s? How important are considerations of a work's thematic concerns, its relationship to specific cultural forms and traditions, or its author's biography?</description>
