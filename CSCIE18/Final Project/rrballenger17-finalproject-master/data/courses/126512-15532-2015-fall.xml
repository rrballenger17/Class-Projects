            <description>An advanced seminar on current topics in behavioral ecology research of chimpanzees and bonobos. Topics will include: foraging, dominance, cooperation, adolescence, reproductive strategies, culture, ranging, cognition, molecular ecology, and relationships. We will discuss behavioral flexibility of chimpanzees between different communities across Africa and learn how to collect and analyze behavioral data. We will compare the behavior of chimpanzees and bonobos with that of humans and examine how these species might serve as models for human evolution.</description>
