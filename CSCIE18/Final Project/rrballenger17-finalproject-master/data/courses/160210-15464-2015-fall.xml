            <description>A studio course that seeks to approach sculpture through narrative, exploring how different forms of narration might appear in sculpture or be used to suggest process.&amp;nbsp; Objects and stories might mutually influence each other or transform over time.&amp;nbsp; A sculptural installation, developed over the course of the semester, generates room for many meta-narratives, while a self-made publication will both document and fictionalize the work.</description>
