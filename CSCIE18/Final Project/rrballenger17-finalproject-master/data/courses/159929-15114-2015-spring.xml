            <description>This course examines the role of meaning-making in political life, focusing on how people&amp;#39;s understandings of political phenomena affect their political choices, how political actors frame their claims in order to mobilize public support, and how political institutions and bureaucratic classification systems shape inequality. The material will prepare students for developing their own research projects, which will be collaboratively workshopped in class.</description>
