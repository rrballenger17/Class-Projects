            <description>Natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and volcanic eruptions have major impact on society and cause great tragedies.&amp;nbsp; Dramatization of these phenomena resulted in a number of motion pictures, and while most movies have some scientific foundation in their depiction of the natural events, they inevitably exaggerate or introduce fiction.&amp;nbsp; Through examination and discussion of real and fictitious effects, this seminar aims to develop appreciation for and interests in the underlying science behind natural phenomena.</description>
