            <description>This course explores the development of Persian literary theory from the 11th&amp;nbsp;century onwards, with readings from the major authors who shaped the technical (Raduyani, Rasid al-Din Vatvat, Sams-e Qeys-e Razi, Hoseyn Vaez-e Kasefi), didactic (Keykavus, Nezami Arudi) and philosophical (Nasir al-Din Tusi, Jami) trends in classical literary scholarship. Students will become acquainted with the tools and concepts of literary analysis developed in pre-modern Iran and exert their skills through the practice of close reading and discussion of select literary material.</description>
