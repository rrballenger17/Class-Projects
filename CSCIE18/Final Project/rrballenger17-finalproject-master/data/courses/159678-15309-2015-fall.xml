            <description>In this course, we will examine the several dimensions and levels (domestic, international) of the ongoing crisis in, around, and about Israel/Palestine.&amp;nbsp; In what ways is the Arab-Israeli conflict central to broader political patterns in the region, and why has it proven so intractable?&amp;nbsp; How have the various parties to the conflict defined its stakes, understood their interests, viewed their adversaries, mobilized support, and formulated policy?&amp;nbsp; What possibilities does the future hold?</description>
