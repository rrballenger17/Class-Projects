            <description>This drawing based studio course will foreground the surface and structure on which drawing can be made. Playing within conventions and expected boundaries, drawing becomes a noun, an object, a finished artwork. Focus is on gaining visual understanding and intentional skill in order to have control over the merging of form and content in ones work. Students will create a portfolio investigating personal interests based on concepts covered in class following each topic and assignment. We will draw a lot!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</description>
