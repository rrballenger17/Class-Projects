            <title short_title="ENG-SCI 24">Flavor Molecules of Food Fermentation: Exploration and Inquiry</title>
            <prereq>Recommended: Ls1a , LPSA or equivalent; first semester Organic Chemistry recommended but not required.</prereq>
            <description>Course description: Microorganisms produce a diverse array of specialized small molecules as part of their metabolic processes. In this course we will study the production, properties, and characterization of these molecules through the lens of food fermentation. In particular, we will focus on the small molecules that contribute taste and aroma in fermented foods. Students will experience the scientific inquiry process in a creative way by designing and implementing their own research project based on a fermented food of their choosing. Still a field with much potential for discovery, interested students are invited to continue their research project in the summer.</description>
