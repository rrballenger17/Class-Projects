            <description>The U.S. &amp;ldquo;energy revolution&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; nonconventional oil and gas production (fracking), increasing use of renewable energy, and reduced demand &amp;ndash; has contributed to a sharp decline in U.S. oil imports, a 10% reduction in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, and economic growth. This course examines the changing U.S. energy landscape, energy security, U.S. climate policy, and the connection between these issues and our own lives. Four case studies (biofuels, mining coal on public lands, regulating carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, and university divestment) illustrate the economic considerations, tradeoffs, and legal and political constraints facing U.S. energy and climate policy in practice.</description>
