We will investigate all aspects of the mise-en-sc&amp;egrave;ne through exercises in screenwriting, directing professional and amateur actors, storyboarding, lighting, sound design, art direction, and digital editing. Students will also research and develop short scripts to be produced during the spring term. Occasional in-class workshops by film professionals and artists.</description>
