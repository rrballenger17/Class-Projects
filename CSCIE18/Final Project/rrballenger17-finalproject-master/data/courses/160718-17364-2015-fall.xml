            <notes>This course complements the jointly listed Wellesley Coll./Harvard University course (French 182) taught at the Wellesley Newhouse Humanities Center on Tuesday evening 6-8 pm. But participation in the joint Wellesley/Harvard course, although recommended, is NOT a requirement for enrollment in this course.  This course is taught in English, but students specializing in French will have a session in French and write their papers in French.</notes>
