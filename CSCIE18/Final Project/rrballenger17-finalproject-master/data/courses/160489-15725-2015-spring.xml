            <title short_title="GOV 94MH">Power, Politics, and the American City</title>
            <description>This course intends to help revive the study of American cities as politicalentities. Pushing beyond the anecdotal accounts associated with city politics,the course applies modern political science methodology and new, continually evolving data to answer the fundamental question: Who has power in the American city? And, more importantly, what does this power mean for its citizens?</description>
