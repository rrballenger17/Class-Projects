            <description>Introduction to designing circuits to solve real problems. Two lecture and two lab sessions a week blend instruction with hands-on lab work to emphasize understanding, building and testing circuits. The course incorporates useful design experiences from day one. Covered topics include amplication, feedback, impedance, stability, filtering, switching, digital logic, microcontrollers, and more. The class ends with an open ended project that challenges students to build on core concepts.</description>
