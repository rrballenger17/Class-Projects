            <description>Not only do emotions permeate our everyday lives, they have aided in the survival of the human species. But what are emotions, and what are they good for? What causes us to experience an emotion? And how do emotional responses, in turn, influence our perception, memory, decision-making, and psychological well-being? This course will address these questions by drawing on key advances from historical, philosophical, psychological, and neuroscientific perspectives.</description>
