            <notes>Madina Agenor  </notes>
            <description>This interdisciplinary seminar examines how gender, poverty, development and global health policies, legacies of colonialism, and social institutions influence sexual and reproductive health outcomes (pregnancy, maternal health, HIV/AIDS, cervical cancer, sexual violence) and access to sexual and reproductive health services (family planning, abortion, HIV testing and counseling, cervical cancer screening) among women in low-income countries. We will address how social and economic context affect&amp;nbsp;women&amp;#39;s sexual and reproductive health across countries in the Global South&amp;nbsp;and examine how inequities based on socioeconomic position, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, and sexuality shape women&amp;#39;s sexual and reproductive health inequities within these countries. Further, we will discuss how community-based health interventions that target the social determinants of health at multiple levels can help promote the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women in low-income countries.</description>
