            <description>Documentary film production has been part of Latin American cinema since its origins. Non-fiction filmmaking was an essential component for two of the region&amp;rsquo;s most important film movements, Brazil&amp;rsquo;s Cinema Novo and the New Cuban Cinema. Currently, the Latin American documentary is enjoying a period of extraordinary vitality and international acclaim. This course traces the development of the form from the 1960s onwards, paying special attention to the interaction of the documentary with shifting notions of politics.</description>
