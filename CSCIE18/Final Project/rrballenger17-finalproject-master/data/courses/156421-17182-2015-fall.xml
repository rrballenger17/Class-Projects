            <description>Understanding the determinants of the wealth of nations has long motivated the study of economics and it is arguably the most important problem in the field for human welfare. This seminar will examine the problem of economic development, looking both at historical experience and at contemporary issues in developing countries. It will focus on approaches from economics, but will also draw on other disciplines, including history, political science, and sociology.</description>
