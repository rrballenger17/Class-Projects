            <description>Introduction to medieval chant. Medieval Latin church music, usually called Gregorian Chant, is the oldest surviving repertory of music in western culture, and is still sung today. We will consider the function of chant in medieval society, and the role of chant in ritual and liturgy. Members of the seminar will be expected to sing, but no previous experience or knowledge of notation is required. We will examine manuscript in the Houghton Library. We will study the musical aspects of a few pieces in great detail, and will come to know the great variety and artistry of this timeless repertory.</description>
