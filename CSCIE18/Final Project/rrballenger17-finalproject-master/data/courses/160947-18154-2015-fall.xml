            <title short_title="ENGLISH 190C">Contagion Narratives: Plagues, Fevers, and Outbreaks in Fiction from Defoe to Camus</title>
            <exam_group>FAS14_D</exam_group>
            <description>This course examines narratives about contagious diseases that have threatened global health from the seventeenth century to the present-plague, smallpox, yellow fever, tuberculosis, influenza, and others. We will read novels and short stories by Defoe, Hawthorne, Maupassant, Gaskell, James, Chekhov, Stoker, Katherine Anne Porter, Camus and other writers who explored the physical, social, and psychological effects of contagion in their fiction. Along the way, we will chart the history of epidemiology and germ theory, considering how the expansion of biomedical knowledge gave rise to innovations in narrative form.</description>
