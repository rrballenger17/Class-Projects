            <notes>In our daily lives we negotiate our relation to the authority of government, religion, school, parents, and peers. But what is authority? How does an entity gain authority in the first place? What happens when authority is abused? What does it mean to challenge authority? And what does authority have to do with human rights? We&amp;rsquo;ll begin by reading the many-times-banned  One Flew Over the Cuckoo&amp;rsquo;s Nest , and we&amp;rsquo;ll investigate that explosive novel&amp;rsquo;s complex and nuanced treatment of, and reaction to, authority. Next, we&amp;rsquo;ll read work by one or more international authors. These formerly or currently &amp;ldquo;at-risk&amp;rdquo; writers will visit our class, and we will analyze their work and what it reveals about authority and what happens when a writer who challenges governmental and cultural authority speaks openly about, and through, her/his work. This ongoing inquiry into the nature of authority will shape our research topics in the third unit, when we will investigate and theorize answers to questions arising out of our explorations of such topics as authority and: education, language and rhetorical strategy, politics, human rights, and art.  Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.</notes>
