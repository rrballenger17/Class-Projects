            <notes> Offered jointly with the Kennedy School as IGA-217.</notes>
            <description>The United States is the most powerful player on the international scene today, and is unlikely to relinquish that position any time soon.Â&#160; Understanding how and why this condition arose, and what it means for world affairs today, is our concern in this course.Â&#160; The emphasis is on U.S. policymaking over the past century, with due attention to the international and domestic political context in which decisions were made.Â&#160; Issues to be explored include the tension between isolationism and interventionism and between unilateralism and multilateralism; the emergence of the U.S. as a superpower; the Soviet-American confrontation; the rise of presidential power in foreign affairs; the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; and the nature of American power in today&amp;rsquo;s world.</description>
