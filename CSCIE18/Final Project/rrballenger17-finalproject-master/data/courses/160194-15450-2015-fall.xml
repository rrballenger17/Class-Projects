            <description>The big questions considered are those that must be posed to do physics, and those that reflect on the broader context of physics. What are the limits and domain of applicability of the classical physics studied in high school? How do these relate to special relativity, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory? What is the &amp;quot;standard model&amp;quot; of particle physics and how is it tested? How does physics inform some challenges to our society, such as the options for powering our homes and cars. An additional set of big questions are about the compatibility or incompatibility of physics and religious faith.</description>
