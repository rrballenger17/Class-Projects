            <description>This is a course in linguistic anthropology. We explore key theoretical
                issues in the semiotic anthropology of language use, focusing on communication,
                social (inter)action, representation, cultural conceptualization, and language
                ideology. By presenting many of the most influential and innovative contributions to
                the study of language in culture and society_both recent and classic_the course aims
                to guide students in asking fundamental questions about language and communication
                more broadly as facts of everyday sociocultural experience.</description>

                Education</title>
            <description>Events such as Teach for America's 20th anniversary and films like Waiting
                for Superman highlight urgent concerns about the quality and reach of American
                schooling in the 21st century. Against this backdrop, the course grapples with
                several dilemmas that have defined American K-12 education throughout history. What
                constitutes educational excellence? Can excellence be achieved for everyone? Why do
                we have schools and what is their purpose? Given that families, politicians, and the
                courts often disagree vehemently about the answers to these questions, the course
                considers who and what will define the future of American education and its role in
                society.</description>

            <exam_group>FAS13_C</exam_group>
            <notes> Offered jointly with the Business School as 1266, the School of Public Health as
                GHP 568, the Kennedy School as PED-338, the Law School as HLS 2543 and the Graduate
                School of Education as A-819.</notes>
            <description>This course will provide a framework (and multiple lenses) through which to
                think about the salient economic and social problems of the five billion people of
                the developing world, and to work in a team setting toward identifying
                entrepreneurial solutions to such problems. Case study discussions will cover
                challenges and solutions in fields as diverse as health, education, technology,
                urban planning, and arts and the humanities. The modules themselves will be
                team-taught by faculty from engineering, the arts, urban design, healthcare and
                business. The course will embrace a bias toward action by enabling students to
                understand the potential of individual agency in addressing these problems. All
                students will participate in the development of a business plan or grant proposal to
                tackle their chosen problem in a specific developing country/region, emphasizing the
                importance of contextualizing the entrepreneurial intervention. The student-team
                will ideally be comprised of students with diverse backgrounds from across the
                University.</description>

            <notes>If student interest exceeds the course limit, a random lottery will be conducted.
                To enter the lottery, you must add the course to the Study Card and explicitly

                to only those admitted by the lottery; all students will be notified of their
                results. See the course website for more details. Unlike other General Education
                courses, this course assumes advanced coursework in a relevant social science and
                thus is open to freshmen only with permission of the instructor.</notes>
            <description>What gives rise to entrepreneurial opportunity and innovative activity? How
                do innovators and entrepreneurs think about the world? How are organizations born
                and how do they grow? How can innovation and entrepreneurship address the major
                challenges facing the world? The course will address these questions by bringing
                together faculty members of Harvard University to provide a diverse set of
                perspectives on the nature of innovation and entrepreneurship. The course has three
                complementary pedagogical methods. Members of the Harvard Business School faculty
                will provide a set of interactive lectures using case studies that illustrate how
                for-profit and not-for-profit organizations recognize and capitalize on
                opportunities. Second, faculty members from around the University will provide
                lectures on specific areas related to their expertise. Third, a set of group
                projects that allow students to work in the field with sponsoring organizations will
                be completed over the course of the semester.</description>

            <description>This course offers a general introduction to the cultures and beliefs of
                medieval Europe. We focus on a variety of artifacts and cultural productions as the

                specific objects and texts as points ofÂ&#160;entry into a vanished world, we
                encourage students to explore those areas that interest them most, teasing out the
                cultures and beliefs of the past while simultaneously developing their skills in
                research and writing. Through collaborative projects and aÂ&#160;creative
                exploration of texts, images, and collections at Harvard and beyond, students will
                be invited to make their own Middle Ages.Â&#160;</description>

                courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past.</notes>
            <description>The United States has launched numerous projects of military occupation and
                nation-building in foreign lands since the late 19th century. These have been
                contradictory enterprises, carrying ideals of freedom and self-determination
                "offered" by force or by fiat. This course will assess the meanings and legacies of
                these projects by examining the ideas, strategies, policies, and outcomes of
                occupations ranging from the Philippines and Haiti early on, to Japan, Germany, and
                Korea in mid-century to, most recently, Afghanistan and Iraq. The course focuses on
                American activities and ideas but also examines the responses of the
                occupied.</description>

            <description>China was home to the world&amp;#39;s largest economy two centuries ago.
                Within two decades it will be the world&amp;#39;s largest economy again. This course
                uses business as a lens through which to study modern China. Using new Harvard
                Business School cases, we explore traditional family firms and internet startups;
                state-owned enterprises and their private-sector challengers; and the catalytic role
                of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign enterprise in shaping contemporary China. Case
                studies cast light on larger themes: the role of party and government (national and
                local) in business and society; the legal environment; and the global impact of
                China&amp;#39;s development.</description>

            <description>This class familiarizes students with popular films produced during crucial
                junctures in the modern history of the United States, from the Great Depression and
                World War II through the Cold War, McCarthy era, and the 1960s. More specifically,
                we will study how Hollywood's dream factory responded to dramatic challenges that
                states of crisis and emergency posed to the founding ideals of our democracy. We
                will look at the wide range of functions that commercial fantasy productions
                assumed, how they at times legitimated and bolstered the status quo, but at others
                also interrogated, exposed, and even indicted social inequity. Course films provide
                a representative sampling of classical American features from 1932 to 1969,
                including Scarface, It Happened One Night, The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind,
                Citizen Kane, Casablanca, High Noon, The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The
                Manchurian Candidate, and Easy Rider.</description>

            <description>Today we often hear that American democracy is broken-but what does a
                healthy democracy look like? How has American democratic governance functioned in
                the past, and how has it changed over time? This course approaches American history
                with these questions in mind. Based on the case method, each short reading will
                introduce students to a different critical episode in the development of American
                democracy, from drafting of the Constitution to contemporary fights over same-sex
                marriage. The discussion-based classes will encourage students to challenge each
                other's assumptions about democratic values and practices, and draw their own
                conclusions about what "democracy" means in America.</description>

            <notes> //</notes>
            <description>Disease and healing pose pragmatic and moral challenges for individuals and
                societies. Artists and writers have struggled to make sense of these tragic and
                transcendent experiences through fiction, poetry, art, and music. Scholars can
                explore these archives of the illness experience to understand not just disease and
                medicine but also what it means to be human. This interdisciplinary course examines
                how the medical humanities can change how we think about suffering, resilience, and
                care-giving, an endeavor relevant to anyone who expects to encounter these problems
                in life (i.e., everyone). In 2015 the course will focus on epidemics; case studies
                may include plague, tuberculosis, cancer, AIDS, SARS, and Ebola. Future offerings
                might address chronic disease, mental illness, death and dying, or
                caregiving.</description>

            <description>This course will review the devastating impact of representative infectious
                diseases on wars, politics, economics, religion, public health, and society as
                reflected in history, literature, and the arts. We will study how infections spawned
                revolutionary epidemiologic and scientific advances in detection, treatment, and
                prevention. We will address the gaps between discovery and implementation, including
                ethical, social, economic, and health systems barriers to progress. We will confront
                challenges posed by microbial mutation (e.g., antibiotic resistance, evasion of
                immunity, and adaptation of animal viruses to humans). By weaving together knowledge
                from science and the humanities, students will understand the historical and
                contemporary impact of infections and potential solutions to the challenges they
                pose.</description>

            <description>Is there a point to life as a whole? That is the question about the
                "meaning of life," a question that is notoriously hard to make precise but has
                animated much literature, art and philosophy. Philosophers have provided both very
                disheartening answers and more uplifting ones. Serious scrutiny of such answers
                should be of interest to anybody who wishes to make reflection on her/his life as a
                whole part of her/his education. This class is wide-ranging, but its main focus is
                on contributions by relatively recent thinkers in the Anglo-American analytical
                tradition of philosophy.</description>

            <description>This course introduces major works, genres, and waves of East Asian cinema
                from the silent era to the present, including films from Mainland China, Japan,
                Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. We will discuss issues ranging from formal aesthetics
                to historical representation, from local film industries to transnational audience
                reception. This course does not assume prior knowledge of East Asian culture or of
                film studies, but rather seeks to provide students with a basic understanding of
                modern East Asian cultural history through cinema, and with an essential toolkit for
                analyzing film and media, including narrative, cinematography, editing and sound. In
                addition to critical approaches, students are strongly encouraged to creatively
                respond to course materials by collaborating on their own short films, beginning
                with the illustration of film terms in the first two weeks and culminating in the
                Oscar-like "Golden Monkey Awards."</description>

            <description>When the natives of Medieval Rus (later Russians, Ukrainians, and
                Belarusians) accepted Orthodox Christianity in the 10th century, their nature-based
                paganism gave way to a powerfully sensual belief system that made good use of the
                visual and the verbal to prepare these newest Christians for the coming Apocalypse
                and Last Judgment. We investigate this transformation from the conversion of Saint
                Vladimir and the excesses of Ivan the Terrible through the Time of Troubles and the
                modern turn of Peter the Great. The class features close analysis of architecture,
                icons and frescoes, ritual, folklore, literature, and history to understand this
                shift in worldview, including the role of women. Special attention is devoted to the
                ways in which Medieval Rus is portrayed in film, opera, and ballet.</description>

                courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past.</notes>
            <description>How and why did humans evolve to be the way we are, and what are the
                implications of our evolved anatomy and physiology for human health in a
                post-industrial world? Why do we get sick, and how can we use principles of
                evolution to improve health and wellbeing? To address these questions, this course
                reviews the major transitions that occurred in human evolution, from the divergence
                of the ape and human lineages to the origins of modern humans. Also considered are
                the many effects of recent cultural and technological shifts such as agriculture and
                industrialization on human health.</description>

            <title short_title="SCIPHUNV 12">Natural Disasters</title>
            <description>Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods, claim
                thousands of lives and cause tens of billions of dollars in damage each year.
                Moreover, changes in Earth's climate are raising sea level, changing precipitation
                patterns, and likely causing an increase in the occurrence of damaging storms,
                putting more of our increasing exposed global population at risk. In this course we
                develop an understanding of these natural hazards from an earth science perspective,
                and examine several case studies to assess their catastrophic impacts. Given our
                scientific understanding of these phenomena, we examine ways to assess and forecast
                future natural disasters, and to mitigate the adverse impacts to our societies.
                Sections will emphasize the use of GIS technology to measure the impacts of natural
                hazards.</description>

            <description>Explorations of the mythical and social origins, glory days and political
                collapse of the Aztec Empire and Maya civilizations followed by study of the sexual,
                religious and racial interactions of the ``Great Encounter'' between Mesoamerica and
                Europe. Focus on the archaeology, cosmovision, human sacrifice, divine kingship, the
                mystery of 2012 and rebellion in Mesoamerican cities and in colonialism. Hands-on
                work with objects at the Peabody Museum aid in examining new concepts of race,
                nation and the persistence of Moctezuma's Mexico in Latino identities in the
                Mexico-US Borderlands.</description>

            <title short_title="EMREAS 13">Analyzing Politics</title>
            <description>A commonsensical survey of rational theories of politics comprised of: (1)
                individual choice, (2) group choice, (3) collective action, and (4) institutions.
                The underlying theme is that politics may be described and understood as rational,
                goal-seeking behavior by citizens, politicians, bureaucrats, and interest groups in
                various settings. Students are encouraged to think deeply about current events,
                history, and public life generally, as well as to analyze the politics of private
                life--in families, clubs, firms, churches, universities, even Harvard Houses--since
                private politics, like public politics, may be understood in terms of rational
                behavior. Instruction is by lecture, small-group section interactions, and
                experiments.</description>

                all in English translation, are the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey, seven tragedies
                (Aeschylus' Oresteia Trilogy, Sophocles' two Oedipus dramas, and Euripides'
                Hippolytus and The Bacchic Women), and two dialogues of Plato (the Apology and the
                Phaedo, both centering on the last days of Socrates); also, selections from the
                dialogue On Heroes by an eminent thinker in the "second sophistic" movement,
                Philostratus.</description>

            <description>Sound and music are integral parts of all human cultures, and play critical
                roles in communications and social interactions. In this course, we study the
                production, transmission, and perception of sound, with the aim of expanding
                communication, musical, and artistic horizons. The course&amp;nbsp; includes many
                class demos and hands on tools for students to explore. Psychoacoustics (the study
                of how we perceive and interpret sound) is a central theme of the course, providing
                a lens through which we can better understand the generation, propagation, and
                analysis of sound. Student-selected projects (with staff consultation) are an
                important part of the course.</description>

            <description>An interpretive look at the American city in terms of changing attitudes
                toward urban life. City and suburb are experienced as the product of design and

                single-family home, attitudes toward public and private space, the rise of suburbs
                and suburban sprawl, cycles of disinvestment and renewed interest in urban centers,

                courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past.</notes>
            <description>This course seeks to provide a broad historical context in which to
                understand the contemporary political division on the Korean peninsula. It examines
                key historical forces that have created and shaped the two Koreas before, during,
                and after the actual partition of the country in 1945. Topics include nascent
                nation-building efforts between 1876 and 1910, the impact of Japanese colonialism
                and the Cold War, and North/South development and interaction after 1948. The course
                interweaves political, socioeconomic, and cultural themes within an historical
                framework centered on nation-building while also highlighting a number of major
                historiographical issues in modern Korean history.</description>

            <description>Modern society is unthinkable without the photograph, and yet we rarely
                have occasion to ponder what photographs are, what they do, and how they do it. In
                this course, we will consider photography from its origins to the digital era,
                paying particular attention to its role as an engine of belief in various cultural
                domains. Our goal will be to understand more incisively how photographs define and
                shape relations between their subjects and their viewers.</description>

            <description>This course guides students on an exploration of the largest and most
                complex civilization of Pre-Columbian America$the Inca Empire of Andean South
                America. We will address such questions as how did a civilization emerge and thrive
                at 12,000 feet above sea level? How could a state-level society exist without
                markets, the wheel, or writing? In addition to lectures and discussions, students
                will experience the products of Inca civilization through hands-on study of
                artifacts in the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.</description>

            <description>Developmental Psychology explores, first, how universal human capacities
                arise in ontogenesis and, second, how people come to have their unique suite of
                skills and personalities. First, the origins and development of space perception,
                mathematical capacity, moral judgments, and concepts of objects, agents, and social
                relations are studied in relation to two larger time scales: biological evolution
                and historical/cultural change. Second, the course looks at individual differences
                in IQ, executive functioning, and social relationships. The interplay between
                psychological and biological levels of analysis in accounting both for universal
                development and for individual differences is discussed throughout.</description>

            <description>Tokyo has been one of the world's great metropolitan centers since the 17th
                century, both the urban hub of Japanese society and culture, and the place where
                Japanese domestic society and global influences have intersected. This course
                examines trajectories of change in Tokyo's urban culture, lifestyles, social
                structure, and spatial environment across the city's history, using ethnography,
                history, literature, diaries, architecture, photography, art, cartography,
                animation, film and the Internet to explore Tokyo as an urban culture in comparative

            <description>Why is evolutionary theory so controversial in the public sphere? This
                course looks to the history of cultural changes in the West for answers. We cover
                the intellectual structure and social context of evolutionary ideas as they emerged
                in the 19th and 20th centuries, emphasizing Darwinism as a major transformation in
                Western thought. Topics include key aspects of Darwin's ideas; the comparative
                reception of Darwinism in Britain, US, Germany, Russia and France; social Darwinism,
                eugenics and racial theories; early genetics and the search for the gene; religious
                controversy then and now. The course alternates with Culture and Belief

            <description>Caribbean societies are largely the economic and political creations of
                Western imperial powers and are among the earliest products of globalization. Though
                in the West, they are only partly of it, and their popular cultures are highly
                original blends of African, European and Asian forms. The course examines the area
                as a system emerging through genocide, piracy, plantation slavery, colonialism and
                globalization, from a situation of great social and cultural diversity to the
                present tendency toward socio-economic and cultural convergence. Patterns of
                underdevelopment and government are explored through national case studies (Puerto
                Rico, Cuba, Jamaica &amp; Haiti) and selected, region-wide modern issues
                (hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters; migration &amp;
                transnationalism; crime &amp; drug trafficking), as are cultural adaptations through
                studies of Afro-Caribbean religions, folkways, and music. America's special role in
                the region is emphasized.</description>

            <description>The story of Earth from the inception of the universe at the Big Bang to
                the revolution in planetary function and capability associated with the rise of
                human civilization. The aim of the course is to place human beings in a universal
                and planetary context, and to see the steps in planetary evolution as an essential
                perspective on how we relate to Earth today. Topics covered include the Big Bang,
                origin of the elements, formation of minerals, origin of the solar system, formation
                of planets, climate regulation, origin of life, co-evolution of ocean, atmosphere,
                solid earth and biosphere, development of plate tectonics, the modern Earth as an
                interconnected system, and the human era and its consequences for the planet.
                Current environmental problems can then be considered in a planetary context.
                Finally we consider whether Earth may be a microcosm reflecting laws of planetary
                evolution that may be common to a class of planets throughout the universe, or
                alternatively may be a low probability accident.</description>

                impact (obesity, smoking, mental health). Activities include lectures, 3 guided

                natural gas - and even more recently to the development of the ability to tap the
                energy contained in the nucleus. It will discuss the important historical advances
                in the applications of energy, notably in the production and distribution of
                electricity and in the transportation sector - where oil-derived products provide
                the motive force for cars, trucks, trains, ships and planes. It will highlight the
                energy related problems we confront today, with particular emphasis on air
                pollution, on the threat of global climate change, on the hazards of nuclear
                proliferation, and on the risks to national security imposed by our increasing
                reliance on imported sources of oil. It concludes with a discussion of options for a
                more sustainable energy future.</description>

            <description>This course examines ``popular culture'' as a modern, transnational
                phenomenon and explores its manifestation in Chinese communities (in People's
                Republic of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia and North America) and beyond.
                From pulp fiction to film, from ``Yellow Music'' to ``Model Theater'', from
                animations to internet games, the course looks into how China became modern by
                participating in the global circulation of media forms, and how China helps in her
                own way enrich the theory and practice of ``popular culture''.</description>

            <description>This course considers the relationship between life and the planet on which
                it resides. It examines the scientific quest to understand where life might thrive
                beyond Earth. On Earth, life was born of planetary processes and has been sustained
                by plate tectonics and other physical processes. Through evolution, life has in fact
                emerged as major influence on our planet's surface. Fundamental features of
                terrestrial life and evolution are addressed in the context of astronomy, planetary
                physics and chemistry. These, in turn, provide a basis for the exploration for other
                habitable planets, both within our solar system and in the greater
                universe.</description>

                course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for

                both. This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education
                courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past.</notes>
            <description>We study how our understanding of time and of related issues, such as the
                predictability of the future, have evolved over the past three centuries. We start
                with Newtonian mechanics, which envisions a universal time, symmetric between past
                and future. This leads to the concept of a clockwork universe. We then see how
                developments in the 19th and 20th centuries destroy this view of time. In the 19th
                century, the distinction between past and future emerges from considerations of
                statistical processes. In the 20th century, the theory of relativity forces
                fundamental changes in the concept of time. Time ceases to be universal and becomes
                entangled with space and gravity. Quantum mechanics limits the predictability of the
                future and introduces verified effects so weird that Einstein wrote of them, "No
                reasonable definition of reality could be expected to permit this."</description>

            <notes> This course, when taken for a letter grade, may be counted for introductory
                Sociology concentration requirement.</notes>
            <description>This multi-disciplinary course uses Boston&amp;rsquo;s dramatic economic,
                demographic, and physical transformations over the last several decades to help
                students better appreciate, understand and participate in contemporary urban life.
                In particular, it explores four central questions at the heart of any conversation
                about any city. &amp;ldquo;How do things work? What do they mean? How do things get
                done and how should they get done?&amp;rdquo; To answer these questions, the course
                draws on a wide number of sources and disciplines, as well as presentations by
                notable local practitioners, student visits to different parts of Boston, and a
                variety of writing assignments. In all of that work, we take seriously that studying
                a city &amp;ndash; and teaching a Gen Ed course &amp;ndash; is an exercise in
                dissonance, plurality, and negotiation.</description>

            <description>What is a good life? How does it relate to personal happiness, to being a
                good ruler, citizen, or lover? What is the relative value of justice, citizenship,
                loyalty, friendship, personal profit, and pleasure? Is the good life the same for
                everyone? This course is devoted to investigating how classical South Asian
                intellectuals approached such questions and to thinking critically about their
                responses. As we will see, far from being mere artifacts from someone else's
                historical past, classical South Asian texts provide powerful frameworks for
                thinking about our own lives and the ways in which we reason about
                them.</description>

                medicine, law, engineering, business, government, etc., the arts will enhance your
                work and your citizenship. Active citizens construct opportunities for positive
                social change. A lecture series by a range of professionals demonstrates that change
                in practically any field depends on art. Theoretical readings (Schiller, Kant,
                Dewey, Freire, Gramsci, Ranci&amp;egrave;re, Mockus, Boal, Nussbaum, Pasolini, inter
                alia) are grounded in concrete cases of agency. The final project will be a design
                for a creative social intervention, including reflections on creating the
                design.</description>

            <description>The novel is often thought of as a distinctively modern form, but
                Greco-Roman antiquity had its own version. Fictional prose narratives about
                adventure and romance in exotic lands were immensely popular in antiquity. We will
                explore this tradition by reading the five surviving Greek novels, the Golden Ass of
                the Roman Apuleius, and selected other texts, along with works by contemporary
                theorists and critics. Topics include: definitions of the "novel"; ancient
                representations of desire; gender and class politics; relationships between secular
                and religious narratives.</description>

            <description>Criminal trials have served throughout history to enforce revolutionary
                change, to impose conformity and stifle dissent, or, alternatively, to advance

                such issues as who can prosecute; can crimes be defined after the fact; can
                punishing speech be justified? Cases include Socrates, Louis XVI, General Dyer, the
                Soviet purges, Nuremberg, Eichmann, American cold-war hearings, and today's
                international tribunals and truth commissions.</description>

                post-World War II period in the United States and the world. Topics include Cold War
                politics from Eisenhower to Nixon, the civil rights movement, the new left, the
                women's movement, the war in Vietnam, black power, as well as the emergence of a
                revitalized political Right. The legacies of these movements and the more recent

            <description>What is the function of literary texts in moments, from Plato to the

                easily in the revolutionary order. They resist the textual simplicities of
                philosophy. Which do we trust: philosophy or literature? Texts include many found in
                traditional ``Great Books'' courses: Plato, Virgil, Augustine, Dante, Luther,
                Milton, Swift, Rousseau, Twain, Kant, Marx, and Chekov, among others.</description>

            <description>Why is human language capable of conveying meaningful information to a
                degree unmatched by natural or artificial codes? Why does semantic content
                spontaneously attach to speech sounds, but not in the same way to, say, music? We
                claim that this has to do with language being the carrier of a spontaneous form of
                logic. We investigate our hypothesis by using formal models from logic, linguistics,
                computer science, and literary criticism. We show how such models can be helpful in
                better understanding ordinary, everyday communication, as well as literary fiction
                through a reading of texts by Euripides, Cervantes, Austen, Proust, and
                others.</description>

            <description>This course provides an overview of the U.S. health care system in
                historical and international perspective, and engages students in critically
                analyzing health policy issues. The course is focused around three complex and
                interdependent policy challenges that every health system must address: ensuring
                access to health care, paying for new innovations, and improving quality. Using
                primarily an economic lens, students will grapple with the complexity of the issues,
                learn to analyze policy arguments, evaluate evidence, identify tradeoffs, and
                recognize the limits of economic analysis - critical skills for engaging
                constructively as informed citizens in a wide range of policy debates.</description>

            <description>Health and medical care pervade every aspect of our lives. This course uses
                quantitative methods (graphical analysis, algebra, data analysis) to examine issues
                related to health, disease, and systems for delivering health care. Topics to be
                covered include differences in health between rich and poor countries, differences
                in types of medical care and who receives it, and the political context for
                reforming health care policy. Techniques for analysis will be developed and
                demonstrated in class and section. The course uses examples from a variety of
                international settings, but focuses mainly on health and health care in the
                US.</description>

            <description>Incest and parricide, cannibalism and self-blinding: classical mythology
                has fascinated artists, writers, and thinkers throughout western civilization, and
                this course will serve as an introduction to this strange and brilliant world. We
                will move from the very first works of Greek literature through to the classic Greek
                tragedies and the Roman tales in Ovid's Metamorphoses. Along the way, we will
                confront the question of what "mythology" is and how it works, and we will discuss
                how these traditional stories changed over time to fit different cultural
                circumstances. We will also consider ancient rationalizations of myth, the
                relationship of myth and politics, and the reception of classical myth in the modern

            <description>This course views life through multiple lenses. Quantum physics involves
                uncertainty and randomness, and yet paradoxically it explains the stability of
                molecules, such as DNA, that encode information and are critical to life.
                Thermodynamics is about the universe's ever increasing disorder, and yet living
                systems remain ordered and intact. This course will examine how these physical laws
                underpin life and how life itself has diversified since originating 3.5 billion
                years ago.</description>

            <description>This course introduces the global health challenges posed by failure to
                adequately reduce infections, malnutrition, and maternal-child health problems in
                the most vulnerable populations, escalating rates of non-communicable
                diseases/injuries, and emerging health risks that cross national boundaries. We will
                assess social responses to these challenges at the community, national, and global
                levels. Through an understanding of population health measures, we will examine
                patterns of disease/mortality between and within countries, capture important time
                trends, and identify determinants of health inequalities. While emphasizing science
                driven policy, comparative case examples will illuminate influential systemic
                factors, health system performance, and the economic/social/political

                ritual, image veneration, mysticism, meditation, death, and category formation in

            <description>This course will introduce students to nutrition and global health problems
                through exploration of demographic, epidemiological, biological, social, political,
                and economic determinants of nutritional status. Emphasis will be placed on the role
                of nutritional status and dietary intake, both as a determinant and as a
                consequence, of these health problems. Students will be encouraged to think
                critically about the major challenges to improve nutrition and health at a global
                level, with a focus on nutrition and infectious diseases, maternal and child health,
                and chronic diseases. Nutritional assessment, study design, and efficacy of
                nutrition interventions, will be explored in detail.</description>

            <description>Europeans ``discovered'' America in search of foodstuffs, specifically
                spices. And food has been central to the American experience from the starving time
                in early Virginia to the problem of obesity in the United States today. But what is
                American about American food? How have individual food choices and national food
                policies connected Americans to the larger world, both the social worlds of other
                human beings and the natural world of all other living beings?</description>

                history, and then consider various strategies for what might be done to deal with
                it. The likely impacts of continued greenhouse gas emissions will be explored,

                how this can be understood in the context of risk. In the latter third of the class,
                the question of how to mitigate climate change will be discussed, including an
                examination of various options for advanced energy systems.</description>

            <description>An introduction to ten iconic monuments of the Islamic world from the
                beginning of Islam to the early modern period. The course introduces various types
                of building-mosques, palaces, multifunctional complexes-and city types and the
                factors that shaped them, artistic, patronal, socio-political, religio-cultural, and
                economic. Each case study is divided into two lectures. The first presents the
                monument or city by "walking" through it. The second is devoted to themes elicited
                from the example, developed in light of comparative monuments, sites, and/or written
                sources, and to problems of patronage, production, audience and meaning as they
                pertain to architectural history.</description>

            <description>This course is a collaboration between world-class chefs and Harvard
                professors. Each week, a chef will lecture about some aspect of gastronomy. This
                lecture will introduce and motivate a lecture about the science of soft materials by
                a Harvard professor. The course will cover the basic concepts in the science of soft
                materials, providing a solid understanding of their properties and behavior. All
                food is made of soft materials, and cooking relies on many of their fundamental
                properties. The course will also include laboratory work that uses concepts of
                cooking to understand and motivate experimental measurements on soft

            <description>Surveys ancient Egyptian pharaonic civilization. Emphasizes Egyptian
                material culture: pyramids, temples, tombs, settlements, and artifacts. Explores
                major developmental themes that defined the Egyptian state: the geographical
                landscape, kingship, social stratification, and religion. Follows a chronological
                path with excursions into Egyptian art, history, politics, religion, literature, and
                language (hieroglyphs). Also touches on contemporary issues of object repatriation,
                archaeology and cultural nationalism, and the evolution of modern Egyptology.
                Includes field trips to the Egyptian collections of the Peabody Museum and the
                Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, along with immersive 3D computer models in Harvard's
                Visualization Center. No prior experience in Egyptology expected.</description>

            <description>This course considers how Tolstoy and Dostoevsky take up moral inquiry in
                their fiction, introduces students to philosophical texts that informed their major
                fiction, and asks why the novel as a literary genre may be a good forum for the
                discussion of ethics. We will read Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, Dostoevsky's Notes from
                Underground and The Brothers Karamazov, as well as selected texts from Rousseau,
                Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and others.</description>

            <description>This course surveys the nature, types and extent of modern servitude,
                distinguishing broadly between those resulting from international trafficking such
                as trans-national prostitution, human smuggling into bonded labor, child soldiering
                and organ trafficking, and more intra-national forms such as debt-bondage and the
                domestic exploitation of women and other vulnerable groups. Examines the conceptual
                and theoretical issues raised in attempts to distinguish among these types of
                differential power relations; the empirical difficulties of estimating the magnitude
                of what are inherently secretive processes; and the ideological controversies
                surrounding the subject. Explores ethical, socio- political and practical issues
                raised by these trends.</description>

            <description>What happened in the last half century in European culture and politics?
                How can we read history through culture, and culture through history? This
                undergraduate lecture survey offers a general overview of European history since
                1945, with a primary focus on some of the greatest works of postwar European film
                and literature. We will interrogate major trends in cinema and literature (e.g.,
                expressionism, existentialism, neo-realism, minimalism, the New Wave, the realist
                political dramas of the 1970s, and so forth); in conjunction with new modalities of
                political discourse concerning communism, democracy, colonialism, and sexuality.
                Note: The course includes six classic novels by postwar European authors, and nine
                of the greatest postwar films by noteworthy European directors.</description>

            <description>This interdisciplinary course reframes traditional understandings of the
                Civil War in three ways. First, by showing that civil conflict in the United States
                began well before 1861 and ended well after 1865, taking the form of slave uprisings
                and Klan terrorism, as well as conventional war. Second, by showing that the former
                Confederacy won this longer Civil War by establishing a new order of black freedom.
                And third, by placing this war in the context of international politics and trade.
                "Readings" range from fiction, film, letters, and speeches to poetry, pamphlets,
                prints and photographs, songs, and history.</description>

            <description>Modern China presents a dual image: a society transforming itself through
                economic development and infrastructure investment that aspires to global
                leadership; and the world's largest and oldest bureaucratic state, with multiple
                traditions in its cultural, economic, and political life. The modern society and
                state that is emerging in China will bear the indelible imprint of China's
                historical experience, of its patterns of philosophy and religion, and of its social
                and political thought. These themes are discussed in order to understand China in
                the 21st century and as a great world civilization that developed along lines
                different from those of the Mediterranean. This year the course introduces a variety

            <description>Japan is a collection of islands, but its past and present unfolds through
                continuous interaction with wider worlds. This course places Japan in contexts of
                Asian and global history. It begins with the people, institutions, and ideas of
                premodern Japan, from the emergence of a court-centered state 1500 years ago to a
                warrior-dominated society centuries later. We then examine the tumultuous process of
                change from the 19th century through the present and explore how people in Japan
                have dealt with the dilemmas of modernity that challenge us all.</description>

            <description>One of the most astonishing, vibrant, multivalent texts in the English
                language, Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales contains characters high and low telling
                stories of edification and pleasure, in poetry and prose, on topics bawdy and pious.
                We will read this work in its entirety, while also looking at some of Chaucer's
                shorter poems and the historical and cultural milieu in which he
                wrote.</description>

            <description>This course will examine the ways in which a concept of God has informed
                Western moral discourse trying to help students engage the literature as they
                consider why one might think &amp;quot;if there is no God, all is
                permitted&amp;#39;&amp;#39; and why one might think if there is a God, human moral

            <description>What should be the role of money and markets in our society? Are there some
                things that money should not be able to buy? For example: Should people be permitted
                to buy sex, votes, babies, citizenship, or college admission? What about buying and
                selling the right to pollute, procreate, immigrate, discriminate, or to hunt
                endangered species? Should we use markets to allocate health care, education, and
                military service?</description>

                not both.</notes>
            <description>This course examines American youth culture in the "long" 1960s through the
                lens of music in California. Both "popular" and "art" music will be considered,
                including early minimalism, songs from L.A. and the Laurel Canyon crowd, and San
                Francisco psychedelia. In addition to understanding musical forms, performance
                styles, and the effects of technology (radio, recording, electric instruments), the
                class will delve into the politics of race, gender, resistance, and the
                draft.</description>

            <description>The course provides an overview of the energy resources that we use to
                sustain our global economies, and explores the impact of these activities on our
                environment. We address the full life cycle of each energy resource, including its
                origins, methods used to explore for and exploit it, how it is used in our
                economies, and the environmental impacts of these activities. Topics include coal,
                petroleum (conventional and unconventional), nuclear power, geothermal systems, and
                renewable energy options (hydro, tidal, solar, wind power). Lectures and labs will
                introduce students to data and methods used in these energy and environmental
                sectors.</description>

            <description> Is morality found or made? Every belief comes from someplace and
                somewhere, but we rarely think this affects its truth. Is morality neatly separable
                from the pathways and contexts thanks to which it comes to our attention? Taking
                contemporary human rights norms, laws, and movements as a case study, this course
                examines this question. We will study where human rights norms come from, the
                history of international organizations, and how non-governmental actors came to
                defend human rights. The relationship of human rights to the histories of
                governance, empire, warfare, emotions, and victimhood will be taken
                up.</description>

            <description>Capitalism organizes society around individual pursuits of material gain.
                Capitalism seems to have won the great ideological struggle with other ways of
                organizing society. But there is much discontent: the Occupy Movement made clear
                that even Americans now care about excessive inequality, and many worry about the
                future in an increasingly economically divided society where access to technology
                richly rewards some to the exclusion of many others. Capitalism is also closely
                associated with what is arguably the biggest policy problem of the 21st century:
                climate change. So how can we justify capitalism? And what are feasible alternative
                ways of organizing society?</description>

                Instructor Signature Required for Enrollment. This section of the course is limited
                to 12 students. It is intended for students who, on the basis of their high-school
                preparation for writing and science, expect that they would benefit from additional
                faculty instruction. The Psychology concentration counts this course as equivalent
                to other versions of Science of Living Systems 20 in terms of concentration
                requirements and pre-requisites. Students who have completed another psychology
                course (including AP Psychology) may not enroll in this seminar.</notes>
