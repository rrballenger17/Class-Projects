            <prereq>Course open to Freshman Students Only</prereq>
            <description>People everywhere tell stories to express both the verities and contradictions found in experiences of everyday life. Based on storytelling traditions, a narrator shapes the story to reflect his or her own intentions, making it personally expressive as well as publicly meaningful to a particular audience. This seminar examines the nature of storytelling, its enduring appeal, and its ability to adapt to multiple technologies (print, film, internet). Participants engage in the storytelling process itself.</description>
