            <description>This class introduces the short screenplay -anywhere from one to thirty formatted pages. Students will learn the basics of this challenging form by viewing short films and reading short screenplays, short stories, and short creative essays.We&amp;#39;ll focus on character and plot in the scripts we develop because many short films-even highly lauded ones-are lacking in these areas. The goal of the course is to write scripts that can actually be produced, so we&amp;#39;ll also consider budgetary matters when we&amp;#39;re writing.Prior screenwriting experience is required.</description>
