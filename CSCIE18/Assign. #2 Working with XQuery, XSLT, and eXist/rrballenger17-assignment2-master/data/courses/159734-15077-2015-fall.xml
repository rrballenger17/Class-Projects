            <description>Politicians, writers, religious leaders, and others today make arguments using the Bible, whether leading with the clause &amp;ldquo;The Bible says. . .&amp;rdquo; or through allusions to or quotations of the Bible. Together in this seminar we&amp;rsquo;ll learn and practice the analytical tools for addressing such claims. The seminar explores ancient and modern formations and uses of the Christian Bible, including ancient processes of canonization. It also explores how the Bible has been mobilized recently in the U.S. to address issues of sex and sexuality, economics, ecology, race, and slavery.</description>
