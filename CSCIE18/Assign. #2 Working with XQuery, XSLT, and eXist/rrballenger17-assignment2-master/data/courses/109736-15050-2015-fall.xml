            <description>The course invites students to explore the distinctive characteristics of legalistic modes of thought and the moral justifications offered for legalism. We will also consider a variety of moral objections to legalism: the power of romantic resistance to rule-making and rule-following, "realism" and others. Legalistic practices and institutions - juries, university disciplinary committees, contracts, "truth commissions", and others -- provide materials for reflecting on the use and misuse of rule-making and rule-following. Readings include political theory, literature, and court cases.</description>
