            <description>We will explore the implications of interacting trends in population, diet, and climate for food security.&amp;nbsp; The course begins with some background literature on food security, initially juxtaposing Malthus and Boserup, and then moving to Sen.&amp;nbsp; The primary focus, however, is a data-driven exploration of food security through analysis of weather, climate, demographics, and yield.&amp;nbsp; Specific questions that we will empirically address are how temperature and precipitation influence yield outcomes?&amp;nbsp; Can agriculture be adapted to a changed climate?&amp;nbsp; How will demographics and diet shift in the coming decades?&amp;nbsp; Will the green revolution continue to yield steady increases?&amp;nbsp; And can we predict famine?</description>
