            <description>This seminar focuses on the history of public health and welfare in America and Europe, from the pre-modern period to the present. &amp;nbsp;We will explore crises and responses to epidemics, vaccination, new scientific and medical discoveries, chronic poverty, severe climate change, famine and outbreaks resulting from global travel and exploration. In all instances, we will pay particular attention to the experience of those affected, as well as the expectation, legal justification and effects of government response. There are no pre-requisites to enroll in the course.&amp;nbsp;</description>
