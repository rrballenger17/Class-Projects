            <title short_title="ASTRON 191">Astrophysics Laboratory</title>
            <notes> Primarily for concentrators in astrophysics or combined concentrators with physics. Students with physics as their primary concentration, but with a serious interest in astrophysics, may take this to satisfy their laboratory requirement (in lieu of Physics 191) upon petition to the Head Tutor in Physics. This course is offered each year.</notes>
