            <description>St. Louis was the epicenter of American empire in the nineteenth century: the point of embarkation for Lewis and Clark; the military headquarters for U.S. Indian wars.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It was likewise central to the history of slavery: from the Missouri Compromise to Dred Scott.&amp;nbsp; The city&amp;rsquo;s intertwining of the history of empire and race continued through the twentieth century in its prominent role in the defense industry as well as the history of segregation, urban &amp;ldquo;redevelopment,&amp;rdquo; and police violence. How does the global capitalist and imperialist history of St. Louis relate to its recalcitrant inequality, structural racism, and endemic violence?</description>
