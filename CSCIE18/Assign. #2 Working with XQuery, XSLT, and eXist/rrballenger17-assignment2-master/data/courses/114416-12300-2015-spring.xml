            <description>The origins of western philosophy. We will survey the fragmentary evidence remaining for the pre-Socratic philosophers, then spend most of the course examining questions raised and arguments put forward by Socrates (as portrayed by Plato), Plato, and Aristotle. What is it to learn, understand, and explain something? What are the most basic entities? What should be our highest aim in life? What is the difference between &amp;lsquo;philosophy&amp;rsquo; and other (literary, political, religious, scientific) endeavors?</description>
