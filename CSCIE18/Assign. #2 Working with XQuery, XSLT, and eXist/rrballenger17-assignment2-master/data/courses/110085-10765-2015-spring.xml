            <description>A study of the Renaissance Portuguese imagination through the work of LuÃ­s de CamÃµes. The course will center on the epic and lyric poetry of CamÃµes as a way to think broadly about the literary and intellectual currents of the 16th century. Empire, the structure of the cosmos, and mythography will figure into our analyses. To promote an understanding of the international culture of letters and humanism, authors from Spain, Italy, and France will also be included. Prerequisite: Reading knowledge of Portuguese.</description>
