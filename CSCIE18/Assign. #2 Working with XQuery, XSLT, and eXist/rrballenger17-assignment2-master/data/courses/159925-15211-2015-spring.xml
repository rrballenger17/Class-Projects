            <description>Development is a complex term. &amp;nbsp;Although we measure it with some proxies of prosperity it does not only refer to the economy of a country or a society. One definition might be that development is a cumulative historical process, in which the economy grows with increased productivity and individuals live under better conditions with equal social rights and opportunities. This course opens up the complex puzzle of socio-economic development, and analyzes the problem from a global, historical, and comparative perspective. The course starts with discussions around the term &amp;quot;development&amp;quot; and then continues with canonical theoretical contributions from different disciplines. The last part of the course explores the policy aspect of development with examples and case studies from around the world.</description>
