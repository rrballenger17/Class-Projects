            <notes> Physics 123 is the same course as Physics 223; if you are a graduate students, please enroll in 223. Physics 123 is also offered as Engineering Sciences 153. Students may not take both for credit. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Science of the Physical Universe.</notes>
            <description>A lab-intensive introduction to electronic circuit design. Develops circuit intuition and debugging skills through daily hands-on lab exercises, each preceded by class discussion, with minimal use of mathematics and physics. Moves quickly from passive circuits, to discrete transistors, then concentrates on operational amplifiers, used to make a variety of circuits including integrators, oscillators, regulators, and filters. The digital half of the course treats analog-digital interfacing, emphasizes the use of microcontrollers and programmable logic devices (PLDs).</description>
