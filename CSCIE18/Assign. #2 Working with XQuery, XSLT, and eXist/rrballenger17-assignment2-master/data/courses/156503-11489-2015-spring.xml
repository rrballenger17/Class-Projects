Students will be expected to rehearse between each coaching and to participate in chamber music studio classes throughout the semester, which will be led by the Parker Quartet. Auditions will be held in the first week of the semester, either in conjunction with HRO auditions or on a separate non-HRO audition day.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Students interested in enrolling only in Music 189, auditions will be held at dates to be announced.&amp;nbsp;</description>
