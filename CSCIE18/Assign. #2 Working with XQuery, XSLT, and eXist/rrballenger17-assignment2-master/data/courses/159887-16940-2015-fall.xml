            <exam_group>FAS13_E</exam_group>
            <description>What does it mean to &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; feminism, or to &amp;ldquo;be&amp;rdquo; a feminist in the 21st-century United States? What can we make of the dominant social expectations for a woman&amp;rsquo;s life? This course explores contemporary ideals of feminine success, including their physical, familial, professional, and political manifestations. We will engage with highly-contested topics&amp;mdash;including sexual violence and Title 9; work-life balance; the imperatives of self-care and presentation; and new models for sexuality, reproduction, family, motherhood, and domestic life&amp;mdash; using the tools of theory and cultural studies to interrogate their framing within popular discourse. Throughout, we will critique ideological formations of gender,&amp;nbsp;particularly as bounded by race, class, and sexuality.</description>
