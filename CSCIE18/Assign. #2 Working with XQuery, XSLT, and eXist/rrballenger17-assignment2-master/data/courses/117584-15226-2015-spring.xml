            <description>At its core, the study of social inequality seeks to answer two simple questions: who gets what, and why? This course will begin with a descriptive assessment of how socioeconomic resources are distributed by social class, race, and gender. We will then explore the social processes, structures, and institutions that influence the distribution of these resources. Course materials will combine cutting edge data with a selection of books that have defined contemporary research on social inequality.</description>
