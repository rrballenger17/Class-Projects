            <notes> This course has a mandatory weekly film screening Tuesday, 2-4.</notes>
            <description>A course that explores the history of visual music throughout the 20th century and across different media. Our topics will range from early avant-garde films and Disney ani-mations to post-war art scenes and pioneers of electronic music to a survey of jukebox films and music videos. By bridging the gap between experimental and popular approaches to visual music, this course will provide a multi-layered history of the inter-relations between film, video, animation, and music.</description>
