            <description>Scaling computation over distributed computing systems is essential for applications such as mathematical optimization involving massive amounts of data. For example, it can speed up performance tuning of a machine learning model by orders of magnitude. This is a rapidly advancing area with high interest from both academia and industry. In this course, students will learn not only efficient but also principled methods of mapping computation onto a large number of distributed compute nodes. Important, yet often difficult-to-comprehend concepts and techniques, will be covered. After having taken the course, it is expected that students can dive into these topics deeply by themselves, as needed.</description>
