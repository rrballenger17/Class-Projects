            <title short_title="TDM 120">What's so Funny?: Introduction to Improvisational Comedy</title>
            <notes>Enrollment will be determined by an interview/audition on the first day of class. &amp;nbsp;(The former Dramatic Arts 120. Introduction to Choreography, is now TDM 140.)  </notes>
            <description>Comedy has often been thought of as the poor relation to Drama but, as Lenny Bruce said, &amp;quot;the only honest art form is comedy because you can&amp;#39;t fake it.&amp;quot; We will attempt to take comedy seriously by studying its component parts and engaging in committed, creative and collaborative &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; that will tap into each student&amp;#39;s personal, individual sense of humor. The class will focus on the basics of improvisation: group games, narrative skills, patterns, offers, spontaneity, agreement, using the space around you, building on-stage relationships and, eventually, scene work.</description>
