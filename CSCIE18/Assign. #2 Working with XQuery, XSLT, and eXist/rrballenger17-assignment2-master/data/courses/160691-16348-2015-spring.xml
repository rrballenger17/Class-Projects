            <description>Although converging evidence suggests that our brains are virtuoso predictors at the millisecond time-scale, people have a great deal of trouble simulating their future states. Why is it that we are so good at short-term predictions but fail to know how long it will take us to complete assignments, how embarrassing we&amp;rsquo;ll find our high school yearbook quotes, or how happy our choices will make us? This course attempts to answer these questions by examining prospection, our ability to simulate the future. Particular attention will be paid to systematic ways in which our predictions about the future go awry.</description>
