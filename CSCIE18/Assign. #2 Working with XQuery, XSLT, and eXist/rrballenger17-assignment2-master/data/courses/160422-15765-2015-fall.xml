            <description>Cities are one of humankind&amp;#39;s most richly complex inventions and can best be understood through both creative and critical thinking. Offered in connection with a Mellon-funded initiative in Architecture, Urbanism, and the Humanities, this course invites you to join an interdisciplinary investigation of the urban form and fabric, socio-cultural life, and artistic representation of five iconic cities &amp;mdash; Boston, Berlin, Moscow, Istanbul, and Mumbai. We will treat literature, film, and photography alongside cultural history, experiment with urban fieldwork, and use digital tools for mapping and curating virtual exhibitions.</description>
