            <description>The development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz ranks among the greatest achievements of the past millennium. This course will help you see why by introducing: how differential calculus treats rates of change; how integral calculus treats accumulation; and how the fundamental theorem of calculus links the two. These ideas will be applied to problems from many other disciplines.</description>
