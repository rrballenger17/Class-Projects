            <title short_title="ENGLISH 287">Conrad, Naipaul, Coetzee: Genealogies of the Global Imagination: Graduate Seminar</title>
            <description>The novels of Conrad, Naipaul, and Coetzee have a particular value to contemporary discourses on global culture. For these writers, the experience of Empire was as much an ethical and aesthetic project as it was an economic or political venture. Our study will focus on their reflections on the problematic project of joining diverse cultures and distant territories in a global network and on the role of figurative language and fictional forms in imagining community and communication on a global scale.</description>
