            <description>An introductory course that focuses on the language of film and moving image media. It will provide the students with the analytical tools to respond both critically and creatively to moving image media, with an emphasis on close formal analysis. In the interest of exploring the vast possibilities of the moving image, we will watch a broad selection of narrative and non-narrative works from around the globe alongside canonical feature films.</description>
