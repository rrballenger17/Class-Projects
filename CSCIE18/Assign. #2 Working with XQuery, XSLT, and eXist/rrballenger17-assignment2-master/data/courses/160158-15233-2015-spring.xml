            <description>We will study how twentieth-century American intellectuals justified and criticized capitalism and its effects on the nation. We will read philosophers, social and cultural theorists, economists, and historians. When are market-made inequalities of wealth and power just? How does capitalism&amp;nbsp;shape morality and desire? What is the relationship between capitalism and other forms of power (e.g. gender, democracy)?</description>
