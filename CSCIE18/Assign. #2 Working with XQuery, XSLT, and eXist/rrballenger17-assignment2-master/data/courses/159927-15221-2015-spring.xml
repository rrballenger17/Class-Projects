            <title short_title="SOCIOL 121">The Pursuit of Community in America</title>
            <description>What is community?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Where does it come from, and what does it accomplish?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To engage these questions, we will explore community from three distinct but complimentary perspectives: ethnography, intention, and policy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We begin with classic accounts of urban and suburban communities, and more recent work on communities struggling through changes like gentrification or environmental disasters.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;From there we turn to communities formed through intention: cults, communes, workplace cultures, social movements, and virtual networks.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Finally, we consider how community enters the policy and planning domain, through community policing and new urbanist planning principles.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Students will have opportunities to reflect on their own ideas about community via analytical response papers and an original piece of research exploring a community of their own choosing.</description>
