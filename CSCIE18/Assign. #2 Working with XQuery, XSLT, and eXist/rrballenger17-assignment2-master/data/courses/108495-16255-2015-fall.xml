            <exam_group>FAS14_H</exam_group>
            <description>As National Security Adviser and Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger was the architect of the policy of d&amp;eacute;tente with the Soviet Union, of the &amp;quot;opening&amp;quot; to China, and of the effort to salvage &amp;quot;peace with honor&amp;quot; in Vietnam. Yet Kissinger should be understood as a scholar as well as a statesman. Using selections from his writings, this seminar will assess Kissinger in his own terms and in the context of modern international history.</description>
