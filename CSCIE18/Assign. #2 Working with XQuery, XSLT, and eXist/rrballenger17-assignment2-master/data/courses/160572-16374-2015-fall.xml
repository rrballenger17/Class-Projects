            <description>People did not discover America, they made it. The goal of this reading seminar is to introduce students to the history of working people in North America and beyond. We will begin with labor systems among Native American societies prior to European contact and will conclude with current debates about the future of work and capitalism in the United States and elsewhere. Topics to be discussed include theories of labor and capital, settler colonialism, indentured servitude, slavery, socialism, the New Deal, the service economy, and global inequality.</description>
