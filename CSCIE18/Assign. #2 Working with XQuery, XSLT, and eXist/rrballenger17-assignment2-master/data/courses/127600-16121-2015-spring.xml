            <description>The objectives of this course are to enhance and supplement knowledge of pathophysiology learned in the main course. This course will use critical reading to explore primary literature, and is especially intended for graduate students in the biological sciences. The course materials and discussions will provide a deeper understanding of the application and translation of basic pathophysiology, as found in current biomedical research.</description>
