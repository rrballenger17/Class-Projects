Students will have weekly meetings with the project advisor for the purposes of developing the appropriate background research on theoretical, thematic, regional, and methodological literature relevant to their thesis topic, and fully refining their summer research proposal. The tutorial's final paper will be comprised of a research proposal representing the research undertaken during the semester.</description>
