Macy, based on the work of the American acting teacher Sandford Meisner and the Russian acting teacher Konstantin Stanislavski. In this course, students will focus on rigorous text analysis combined with emphasis on enhancing the actor's spontaneity through training in Meisner's "Repetition Exercise." Students will do scene work drawn from a wide selection of plays.</description>
