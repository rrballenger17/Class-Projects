            <description>The novel is often thought of as a distinctively modern form, but Greco-Roman antiquity had its own version. Fictional prose narratives about adventure and romance in exotic lands were immensely popular in antiquity. We will explore this tradition by reading the five surviving Greek novels, the Golden Ass of the Roman Apuleius, and selected other texts, along with works by contemporary theorists and critics. Topics include: definitions of the "novel"; ancient representations of desire; gender and class politics; relationships between secular and religious narratives.</description>
