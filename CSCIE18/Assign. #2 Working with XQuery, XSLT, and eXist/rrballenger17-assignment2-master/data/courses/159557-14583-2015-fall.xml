            <exam_group>FAS03_D</exam_group>
            <description>Follows the development of two major movements in Russian literature &amp;ndash; Futurism and Formalism - in close conjunction with each other and in the context of Russian Modernism at large. Examines poems, manifestos, theoretical writings, visual arts, theater productions, films. Key questions include: how could Futurism, with its scandalous manifestos and &amp;ldquo;transrational&amp;rdquo; poems, evolve into the Formalist theory with its cult of science and rigorous methodology? How to make sense of the transrational? What made Futurists paint their faces? Works by Bely, Khlebnikov, Mayakovsky, Kruchyonych, Shklovsky, Tynianov, Jacobson, Larionov, Malevich, Zdanevich, Rodchenko, Vertov.&amp;nbsp;</description>
