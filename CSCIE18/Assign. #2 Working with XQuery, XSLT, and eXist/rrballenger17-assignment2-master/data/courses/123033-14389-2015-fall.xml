            <notes> Students may take either Economics 1123 or Statistics 139 for credit. Statistics 139 will not count as an econometrics requirement. Also, Economics 1123 may not be taken for credit if taken after Economics 1126, but credit will be given for both courses if Economics 1123 is taken first.  This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning.</notes>
