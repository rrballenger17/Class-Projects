            <title short_title="HIST 97J">"What is Family History?"</title>
            <description>Every family has a history; every past actor had a family. This section investigates the practices and purposes of family history. We will explore primary sources such as diaries, child-rearing manuals, and portraits, and survey methods ranging from demography to cultural history to biography. Our topics will include the &amp;ldquo;invention&amp;rdquo; of childhood, the meanings of marriage, and the relationship between the household and the state. In addition to tracing the contours of family life across a wide array of times and places, we will investigate the ebbs and flows of family history itself, including the worldwide boom in amateur genealogy today.</description>
