            <description>Three forces have converged to make this the most exciting time for brain science.&amp;nbsp; First, we don&amp;rsquo;t yet understand how the brain works, how it breaks, and how to fix it: we have important questions to answer. Second, a slew of powerful brain methods have emerged and we have entered an era of massive computing power: we have serious tools. Third, more than ever before, there is a social will and now a political mandate to tackle these questions head on: we all want to know more about brains!This course will give you an overview of our current state of brain science knowledge and some basic neuroscience know-how. The content is structured to help you best on that future day when you&amp;rsquo;re an entrepreneur, lawyer, scientist, or the next president, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have the foundation to shape the next decade of brain science discovery and policy.</description>
