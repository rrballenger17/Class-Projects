            <description>Criminal trials have served throughout history to enforce revolutionary change, to impose conformity and stifle dissent, or, alternatively, to advance democracy. Students examine trials in their historical and moral context to weigh such issues as who can prosecute; can crimes be defined after the fact; can punishing speech be justified? Cases include Socrates, Louis XVI, General Dyer, the Soviet purges, Nuremberg, Eichmann, American cold-war hearings, and today's international tribunals and truth commissions.</description>
