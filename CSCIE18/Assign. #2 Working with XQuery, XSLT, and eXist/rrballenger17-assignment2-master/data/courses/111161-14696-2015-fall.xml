In addition, participation in two one-hour workshops is required each week. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning. This course, when taken together with Mathematics Mb, can be followed by Mathematics 1b.</notes>
            <description>The study of functions and their rates of change. Fundamental ideas of calculus are introduced early and used to provide a framework for the study of mathematical modeling involving algebraic, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Thorough understanding of differential calculus promoted by year long reinforcement. Applications to biology and economics emphasized according to the interests of our students.&amp;nbsp;</description>
