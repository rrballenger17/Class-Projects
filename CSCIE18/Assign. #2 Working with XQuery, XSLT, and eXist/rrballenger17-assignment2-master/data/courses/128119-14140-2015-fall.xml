            <description>We will read a selection of Darwin's publications, as well as his private correspondence, paying close attention to the man behind the science as revealed by his writings. We will get to know Darwin, the avid breeder of pigeons, lover of barnacles, devoted father and husband, gifted correspondent and tactician, and remarkable backyard scientist. Together, the class will reproduce ten of Darwin's classic Down House experiments and observations that were central to his case for natural selection and evolution.</description>
