            <title short_title="SOCWORLD 49">The Worlds of Business in Modern China</title>
            <description>China was home to the world&amp;#39;s largest economy two centuries ago. Within two decades it will be the world&amp;#39;s largest economy again. This course uses business as a lens through which to study modern China. Using new Harvard Business School cases, we explore traditional family firms and internet startups; state-owned enterprises and their private-sector challengers; and the catalytic role of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign enterprise in shaping contemporary China. Case studies cast light on larger themes: the role of party and government (national and local) in business and society; the legal environment; and the global impact of China&amp;#39;s development.</description>
