            <description>War, disaster, drought, or famine force people to flee their land. Climate change is contributing to many of these factors. The humanitarian consequences of population flight, including loss of place and livelihood, are filled with complexity, relating to the extent and permanence of environmental destruction wrought by these crises, people's attachment to their homes and ecosystems, the circumstances of departure, the destinations of refuge, and the possibilities for return. These issues will be examined through case studies and review of literature on forced migration and calamity.</description>
