            <notes> Offered jointly with the Divinity School as 2457.</notes>
            <description>This course will explore approaches to God-talk that emphasize&amp;mdash;both in content and in style&amp;mdash;its character as intellectual discourse as well as creative practice. It will engage various contemporary &amp;ldquo;theopoetic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;poethics&amp;rdquo; works to theorize their understandings of the relationship between the imagination, the world, and the divine. Readings will include philosophical and theological texts, including works by Rubem Alves, H&amp;eacute;l&amp;egrave;ne Cixous, Paul Tillich, and Amos Wilder, among others.</description>
