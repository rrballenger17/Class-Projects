            <description>The study of social networks is vast, involving everything from the structure of ties among Facebook friends to the process through which people decide whom to ask for help. In spite of the popularity of social media and recent attention to network data by businesses, the study of networks has a long- standing history, with important contributions by anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists dating back to as early as the 1930s. This course examines two questions in that vast body of work&amp;mdash;how people&amp;rsquo;s behavior is affected by their networks and how they make decisions about how to use their networks.</description>
