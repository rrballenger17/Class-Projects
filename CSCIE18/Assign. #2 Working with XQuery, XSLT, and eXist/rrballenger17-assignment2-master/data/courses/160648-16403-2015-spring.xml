            <description>This sophomore tutorial of the concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media, explores the theater as a medium that brings together all the other arts, from architecture and design to literature and music, through readings, discussions, and exercises. We also consider the intellectual traditions connected to theater, including philosophy, politics, and sociology. Key texts include Plato, Euripides, Brecht, and Churchill; sessions at the Harvard Theater Collection.</description>
