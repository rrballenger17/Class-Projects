            <description>A laboratory course that immerses students in a dynamic project-based research environment. Participate in experimental projects directly linked with ongoing faculty research. Students select a project from the following research tracks: neurobiology, microbial sciences, cell biology, and synthetic biology. New projects, including some in other research fields, are offered every term. In a highly collaborative atmosphere, students form a fully-functional and diverse research group based on the sharing of ideas and progress reports between projects. The spring microbiology project is part of the &amp;quot;genomes to Biomes&amp;quot; series. This course cannot be taken concurrently with LifeSci 100</description>
