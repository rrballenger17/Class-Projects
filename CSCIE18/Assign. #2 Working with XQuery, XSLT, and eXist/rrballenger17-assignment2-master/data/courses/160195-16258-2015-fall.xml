            <description>This seminar will explore historical practices of collecting and displaying Classical art in museums from the earliest periods through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to most recent times, including the contemporary debate about cultural property and the acquisition policies of museums. The seminar will consider how various forms of collecting and archiving &amp;ndash; such as collections of war booty in ancient Rome, cabinets of curiosities in the Renaissance, or modern art museums from the 18th century onwards &amp;ndash; have shaped our knowledge and understanding of the past.</description>
