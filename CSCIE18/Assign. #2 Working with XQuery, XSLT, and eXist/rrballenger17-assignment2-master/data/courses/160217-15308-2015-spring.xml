            <description>We will study films that concern themselves with the enchanted state of early childhood; and with the myths children create to make sense of the world. We&amp;rsquo;ll also look at films made with the same sense of wonder and uninhibited daring children experience when making art. We&amp;rsquo;ll study canonical masterpieces, disguised fairy tales, outsider filmmakers, Poverty Row gems, startling experiments and films repurposed by a second director to make new fiction from an intervention.&amp;nbsp;Students will respond with scripts, essays and/or visual essays.
