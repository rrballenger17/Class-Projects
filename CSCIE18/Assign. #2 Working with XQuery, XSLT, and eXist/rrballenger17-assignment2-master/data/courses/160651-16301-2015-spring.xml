            <description>(Taught by Visiting Lecturer Dean Moss.) A fast-paced intensive introduction to multidisciplinary performance art practice. Open to a mix of students with dance, visual, video, and/or theatrical backgrounds, the course will focus on practical strategies employed in the blending of movement, sound, image, and presence in contemporary performance works. Students will use themselves, each other, the immediate environment, and an assortment of media production tools, to embody alternative, non-traditional theater processes and create multidisciplinary performance art projects. Discussion, screenings and reading assignments will provide conceptual and historical context for the course.</description>
